=はじめに=
OpenTTD 1.0.0以降、インストールは簡素化されており、ゲームそのもの(プレイ、グラフィックとも)はオープンソースとなっている。よって、すべてのファイルがインストーラーに組み込まれている。OpenTTDの最新バージョンは[http://www.openttd.org/download-stable ここ]からダウンロード可能である。
インストール自体は若干複雑で、[[en/Archive/Community/Base graphics]]はゲームと一緒に配布されていない。よって、基本グラフィックは[http://www.openttd.org/ downloading the game]には含まれていない。

現在、2種類のベースグラフィックがOpenTTDでは利用可能である。
*  [[en/Basesets/OpenGFX]]:オフィシャルの [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source open source]グラフィックセットで、OpenTTDチームにより作成されたもの。
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon Transport Tycoon Deluxe](TTD)オリジナルのCDから生成したグラフィック(OpenTTDはフリーソフトだが、TTDはフリーソフトではないことに注意)

(訳者注:現在はSteamでも配布されていて、こちらは追加データは一切必要ない。上記インストール方法も訳者は数年前に行ったため正しいかどうか不明。Steamからの入手が妥当だと思われる。2021.8.2現在)

= Installation =
'''Select the installation instructions for the base graphics set you chose and your operating system:'''
:<p style="font-size: 90%">''(If you have access to the TTD base graphics and can't decide what base graphics to use, install the game using the TTD base graphics. OpenGFX can easily be installed afterwards. However, the easiest way is to install the game with all files from the start: TTD base graphics, [[en/Basesets/OpenGFX]], [[en/Basesets/OpenMSX]] and [[en/Basesets/OpenSFX]] files.'')</p>

Using original TTD base graphics

'''5''' Run OpenTTD.

== Installation on Linux ==

#Within Software Center of your distribution (or Package Manager), pick OpenTTD

OpenGFX is faster and prefered.

#Check OpenGFX, OpenMSX, OpenSFX; press download, close window
#In game main menu, select Settings and make sure you are using three packs above

== Manual Installation from source on Linux ==
See [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on GNU∕Linux and 🟉BSD]].

= Files from TTD=
If you're installing OpenTTD with the TTD base graphics, OpenTTD requires several original game files from your Transport Tycoon Deluxe installation CD.

The following files are mandatory. You need to copy them to the /baseset directory, which is in your personal OpenTTD directory. These files contain the graphics and the sound effects:
* trg1r.grf
* trgcr.grf
* trghr.grf
* trgir.grf
* trgtr.grf
* sample.cat


Additionally, you may want to copy the original game music. To accomplish that, you need to copy the /gm/ folder from the TTD CD to the /baseset in your personal OpenTTD directory.


There are a few ways to get these files:
* Copy the folder and files from the TTD game CD to your OpenTTD /data folder.
* Unzip a TTD installation zip file, and copy the folders.
* Install TTD for Windows in another directory and then copy the folders.

= Installing sound and music =
Chances are, your OpenTTD installation already has sound and music. If it doesn't, we recommend to install [[en/Basesets/OpenSFX]] and [[en/Basesets/OpenMSX]] from the in-game content downloader. You need an Internet connection for this. After the download, go to “Game Settings” and select these base sets for sounds and music.

For music to work, your system needs to have MIDI playback support. Most systems should support it out of the box, but if not, consult the manual of your operating system to learn how to get MIDI support.

You can control music and sound playback in-game with the Sound/Music menu. Click the “Play” button to start music playback.

= Installing AI =
AI is neccessary in order to get competing companies in singleplayer. Without AI, the computer won't launch any competing companies, and your company will be alone.

In the main menu, click on the “AI” button, and then on “Download extensions”. Again, you need an Internet connection for this to work. There are a lot of AIs to choose from. We recommend SimpleAI for a start, as it is the most stable one. In the AI menu, you can choose how many computer players there will be in your game.
