OpenTTD has a variety of '''Cheats''' to make gameplay easier. Cheating is not, and never will be possible in multiplayer games the way it is mentioned in this article, but see below for more information on multiplayer cheating.

*'''Ctrl + Alt + C''' -To access the cheat menu press ''Ctrl + Alt + C''. This only works in single player games. If you have another program that responds to this shortcut running, please use ''Ctrl + Alt + <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key Windows]</span> + C''. If your keyboard does not include the Windows keys, you'll need to use the ''Ctrl + Alt + C'' combination, and in order to do that you'll need to first change that other program's settings, close it to prevent it from responding to the combination or adjust hotkeys.cfg.
*On a '''Macintosh''', press ''Control + <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key Cmd]</span> (&#x2318;) + C'' [Or, failing that, ''Ctrl + Alt(⌥) + C''] to access the cheat menu.

Most of the cheats are self-explanatory but a brief description is available anyway.

==Increase money by £10,000,000==
Increases (or decreases) available money by £10,000,000. You can press it as many times as you like. ''Note:'' You cannot decrease your money below £0 pounds with the decrease button.

''Possible Settings:'' Any numerical value which is a multiple of £10,000,000 ($20,000,000), greater than zero.

==Playing as company #==
Allows you to play in any company (whether it be AI or a loaded multiplayer save), control their vehicles, etc.

Save your game before using this cheat because an assertion error may occur and you'll lose all you have been working on.

''Possible Settings:'' Company Number between 1-15 (Max Companies for now)

==Magic bulldozer==
The [[en/Archive/Manual/Magic bulldozer]] allows you to destroy [[en/Manual/Industries]] and other normally unmovable objects such as lighthouses. Magic bulldozer has some side effects though. As not only you as player gain higher bulldozer rights, also the towns get the ability to remove [[en/Manual/Industries]]. 

You can look here to see Magic Bulldozer in action: [[File:en/Manual/Cheat-Magic Bulldozer.png]]

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

==Tunnels may cross each other==
Allows you to build [[en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels|tunnels that intersect]] underground.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

==Build while in pause mode==
{{en/Note|This is not a cheat in 1.1.0, but an Advanced Setting available from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] menu, which allows more control on what is allowed in pause.}}
Allows you to build whilst the game is [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build in pause|paused]]. This was previously a patch but it was changed to a cheat because it gives an unfair advantage over AI players.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

==Jetplanes will not crash (frequently) on small airports==
Large [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] don't have a tendency to crash all the time on small [[en/Manual/Airports]]. They will crash occasionally though, with the same frequency as crashes at other airports.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

==Enable modifying production values==
Allows you to modify the amount of cargo produced by industries.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span> (Although the production value max is 2,040 tonnes/2,040,000 kilograms)

==Switch climate==
You can switch a running game between the four [[en/Manual/Climates]]. This might be useful to obtain vehicles from other climates or just for fun. Note that this might have a few unwanted effects on vehicles, industries and cargo types.

[[File:en/Manual/Switch climate.png|center|frame|Switch climate cheat: a temperate landscape with a toyshop and a house from toyland, a printing works from arctic and some palm trees from tropical climate]]

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''Temperate'''</span>, <span style="color:blue">'''Sub-arctic'''</span>, <span style="color:#f4c430">'''Sub-tropical'''</span>, <span style="color:red">'''Toyland'''</span>

==Change date==
The time is at your hand! You can go back in time or travel to the future with this cheat. Click on the date to enter the desired year directly, instead of incrementing or decrementing it with the arrows.

Unfortunately, it doesn't affect inflation or expired vehicles. To regain access to expired trains, open the [[en/Manual/Console]] and type <code>resetengines</code>. Any vehicles or stations (future [[en/Manual/Airports]]) that become available while you are cheating, will still be available when you go back to the original date. Also, traveling before the year in which you began your game prevents the financial information from working properly.

==Allow Electric Trains to run on normal track==
{{en/Note|This is not a cheat in 0.7.0, but an Advanced Setting available from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] menu, which disables electric rails altogether.}}
Allows electric trains to run on normal track, for those that dislike e-rails, but would like to use the electric rail trains. This can also be fixed using various [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]s

==Cheating in network games==
The cheats listed on above are not available in multiplayer games.  There are two ways to enable cheats in Multiplayer:
* Modify the source code and recompile the game running on the server, something which is heavily frowned upon.
* Enable cheats in a single-player save game and then load the game at the "Start Server" menu.
If you must do this you should at least inform the clients that they are playing on a server with cheating enabled. There are, however, other ways to "cheat" in a multiplayer game.  See [[en/Community/Multiplayer cheating]] for more information on this and how to avoid it.

==Cheat Effects==
If you use or used a cheat in a specific game session, your score will not be included in the High Scores list, in that session, still cheating can be good for debugging/sandboxing purposes. (It's easy to gain money in this game, even with harder NewGRF's but sometimes you just want to test something out.)
