[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Installation FAQ]]



Ten FAQ zawiera pytania na temat instalacji OpenTTD.

== Czego potrzebuję, by uruchomić OpenTTD? ==
Musisz posiadać jeden ze [[pl/Archive/Compilation and Ports/System Operacyjny|wspieranych systemów operacyjnych]]. Potem sprawdź, czy Twój komputer spełnia minimalne [[en/Archive/Manual/System Requirements|wymagania sprzętowe]].

== Jak przebiega instalacja OpenTTD? ==
=== Na Windowsie: ===
:*Bardzo łatwo, tylko kilka kroków:
:#Pobierz instalator Windows OpenTTD ze [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable oficjalnej strony] - albo po prostu archiwum zip z tej samej strony.
:#Kliknij dwukrotnie!
:#Wybierz podstawowe ustawienia, pozwól na zainstalowanie najważniejszych plików.
:#Uruchom OpenTTD.
:#Podziwiaj splendor ekranu powitalnego.

:Oczywiście możesz także pobrać [[en/Development/FAQ development#source-code|kod źródłowy]], jest to najszybsza/najłatwiejsza droga. [prawdopodobnie jakiś żart =>] ''(but if you took the longer route... would it increase the route income?.. or should you wait for monorail... ..)'' 

=== Na Linuxie (kto go używa, niech sobie przetłumaczy ;) ): ===
* As with most things in Linux, there are various ways to get a working copy of OpenTTD:
:* You may find OpenTTD in your distro's packaging system, e.g. Aptitude, Yum, Portage and YaST. For info about using such a system, check your distro's manual or website. This is easiest as it will also install the required base game ressource files.
:* You can find packages for some distros on the [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable project page], such as .deb and .rpm files.
:**You'll need to put a copy of base resource files like OpenGFX into ~/.openttd/data (create that directory, if it doesn't exist).
:* You can download the source and compile the game yourself! You can read how to do this here: [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on GNU∕Linux and 🟉BSD]].
:**You'll need to put a copy of base resource files like OpenGFX into ~/.openttd/data (create that directory, if it doesn't exist).

* Step-by-step in Ubuntu 8.04 onwards:
:* Goto 'Ubuntu Software Centre'.
:* Search for 'openttd'
:*Install Openttd as it comes
:* You can download and install sounds and graphics in the game itself
:** The game data will be saved in "/usr/share/games/openttd/data"
:** Savegames / screenshots etc will be saved in "/home/{username}/.openttd". (Note that this directory may be hidden. To see it click 'View' in the File Browser in your username hame directory and tick 'show hidden files').

=== On Mac OS X (no a z tym tak samo, ale uważajcie na ogryzka!): ===
:*Quite simple, only a few steps:
:#''Obtain'' a copy of [http://www.openttd.org/download-opengfx OpenGFX]
:#Unpack OpenGFX it into ~/Documents/OpenTTD/data (create that directory, if it doesn't exist)
:#Get the OSX bundle for OpenTTD from the [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable downloads page].
:#Mount the downloaded image and copy OpenTTD into a folder of your choice, i.e. /Applications/OpenTTD/ (it is recommended that it's empty as OpenTTD will add files to it).
:#[optional] Also make a "gm" folder, and copy the .gm files across into it for all the cheesy midi goodness.'''[*2]'''
:#Uruchom OpenTTD!
:#[optional] You can now conveniently install sound and music sets be using ingame content download

=== Na innych systemach (i tak każdy ma Windowsa): ===
:*If it is a unix-like system you have good chances to play OpenTTD on it. It runs on more different systems and architectures than mentioned here.
:#Look into the [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|Operating System List]] whether there are reports on your system.
:#Make sure, that the [http://libsdl.org SDL library] is available for your platform and installed on your system.
:#Download the OpenTTD source code and try to compile the game yourself.
:#Add an entry to the [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|Operating System List]], even if you were not successful.

== Czy mogę użyć oryginalnych plików z TTD? ==

W skrócie: żadne pliki z TTD nie są potrzebne, istnieją darmowe podstawowe pliki grafiki, dźwiękowe i muzyczne. Ale wciąż możesz używać podstawowych plików z TTD:

:*If you are not using the installer to install OpenTTD, (or are just curious) you need to copy certain files by hand.
:Required files; put these in the <i>data/</i> folder:
::* Graphic files: <b>trg1r.grf</b>, <b>trgcr.grf</b>, <b>trghr.grf</b>, <b>trgir.grf</b>, <b>trgtr.grf</b>
:::*If you are using the DOS version of TTD to copy the files from, you need the files which are named above but without the "R" on the end, e.g. trg1.grf etc.
::* Sound files: <b>sample.cat</b>
:If you also want music, ''(the all important cheesy midi goodness)'' copy the following files to the  <i>gm/</i> folder:
::* Music files: <b>*.gm</b>
::If there is no gm folder, just create it in the main openttd folder, and put the files there. Note that DOS version of TTD does not have <b>*.gm</b> files.

On *nix computers, you need make sure you have permission to view the above files as a normal user, otherwise, you will only be able to run OpenTTD as root.

== What about nightly builds? ==
The nightly builds can be used parallel to stable build. Download the latest nightly build archive, then extract it into a new folder without installation required. Just run the binary.

To always play the latest nightly you can use an [[en/Archive/Community/OpenTTD Updaters|updater]] to update to latest [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] when you start the OpenTTD.
