[[Translation:en/Community/Play Style/Multiplayer Rules]]
The multiplayer feature of OpenTTD enables you to play against other people from all around the world. In order to have a fun and fair game, there are some simple rules of thumb you can follow.
The [[en/Centralised Authentication]] feature will allow people breaking any of the established rules to be banned from playing on the server.

Each server may have different rules and most of the servers that currently run are not official open TTD servers which means they are not monitored by any open TTD staff members, server operators or administrators.
If you run into trouble try contacting the administrator or operator of the server you are playing on.
If you find an server admin himself is behaving badly use the [[en/Server Blacklist]] to report this server admin to warn other players about his or her behaviour.

''The following rules apply to each of the servers official and non official.''
*'''Don't intentionally block access to industries, large areas of the map or areas that another player is building in.''' If you find another player is building where you wanted to create tracks or roads of your own do not try to hinder their build progress, but build around, over or under it.  If they have built it in such a way that this is not possible, and changing it would not be unreasonably expensive, you can politely request that they make a modification. 
**Buying exclusive transport rights in an town in which you do not have any stakes also counts as blocking access to industries and is also frowned upon.

*'''Don't deliberately sabotage your opponents vehicles.''' In OpenTTD this amounts to deliberately building level crossings where your opponents are running road vehicles and attempting to destroy them with trains; building high constructions nearby small airports which result in plane crashes and also, parking road vehicles in roads that are being used by other companies for the sole purpose of blocking their vehicles. Aside from being unpleasant it will damage your own ratings if you have stations nearby.

*'''Don't cheat to advance yourself within the game.''' Joining an company operated by someone else or starting another company to transfer money to your own company is unacceptable behaviour, unless the originally owning player made it clear that he or she is leaving the game, has no intentions to return and offers themself or their resources to anyone else who wants them. <br>If you discover an exploit which creates wealth, gives an unfair advantage against other players or prevents the normal operation of the game server report it to the OpenTTD developers so the vulnerability can be closed. <br>Don't abuse bugs or exploits because this only harms OpenTTD gameplay and destroys the gameplay of other people.

*'''Chat system''' When using the chat system avoid the use of inappropriately gruesome or hideous subjects; remarks which are sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive or excessively obscene vulgar language. Also do not discuss the use or practice of any illegal activity or provide links to sites that contain any of the aforementioned. Remember that OpenTTD games are played by people of all ages.

*'''Always follow the rules set down by the server owner.''' These may include no "industry stealing" where one player starts a more competitive route than another. This probably varies on an per server basis so if and when an server administrator or operator requests you to stop your current activities because they do not follow the server's guidelines then do so because excessive rule breaking may results in an ban which might prevent you to play on any of the official and non official OpenTTD servers.

*'''Don't take revenge.''' If other people buy all land around your stations or cut you off with rails, road or with the buy land tools do not get "revenge" by blocking their stations or any of the above. This makes you one of them and the server administrators or operators may not be able to differentiate between who started it and may decide to warn, kick or ban both you and the other player who originally started it.

By not following these guidelines you may, at the least, annoy other players.
Players who continue to play unfairly may find themselves warned, kicked or even banned from a server by a server operator.
