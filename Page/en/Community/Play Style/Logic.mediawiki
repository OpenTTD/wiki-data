One day I thought - we have logical ''OR'', why don't make logical ''NOT'' and ''AND''? It's... challenging.

''(Here and afterwards I assume green color as ''TRUE'' and red as ''FALSE'')''
==OR==
[[File:en/Community/Play Style/Logic.or true true.png|left|frame|Arguments are ''TRUE''/''TRUE'']]
The basic ''OR'' is simply created by a one [[en/Manual/Signals|pre-entry signals]] and two pre-exit signals.

[[File:en/Community/Play Style/Logic.or false true.png|128px|thumb|left|''FALSE''/''TRUE'']]
[[File:en/Community/Play Style/Logic.or false false.png|128px|thumb|left|''FALSE''/''FALSE'']]
<br style="clear:both" />
==NOT==
[[File:en/Community/Play Style/Logic.not true.png|left|frame|Argument set to ''TRUE'']]
This looked easy at first, but it took a long time to create this structure.

Here '''n1''' and '''n2''' are the stations for maglev to run between. (Orders set to "[[en/Archive/Manual/Non-stop]]", TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling set to "on"). Notice, that '''n1''' has two platforms. This is why we can't use [[en/Manual/Waypoints]], and this is why we need TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling.

'''a''' and '''b''' are [[en/Manual/Signals]], they stop the train, if argument is ''FALSE'' and move him out of the track.

'''x''' and '''y''' collect the position of the train and close the result signal.
Unfortunately, I've found out a little bug in this scheme. At some times, it [[:File:en/Logic.not bug.png|jams]].
[[File:en/Community/Play Style/Logic.not false.png|128px|thumb|left|Argument set to ''FALSE'']]

<br style="clear:both" />
==AND==
[[File:en/Community/Play Style/Logic.and true true.png|left|frame|Arguments are ''TRUE''/''TRUE'']]
One solution was to make ''A AND B'' as ''NOT((NOT A) OR (NOT B))'', but that would be messy, so I have found out another solution.

Here '''a1''' and '''a2''' are the stations for maglev to run between. (Orders set to "[[en/Archive/Manual/Non-stop]]", TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling set to "on"). Notice, that both stations have two platforms. This is why we can't use [[en/Manual/Waypoints]], and this is why we need TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling.

'''a''' and '''b''' are [[en/Manual/Signals]] (so are '''aa''' and '''bb'''), they stop the train, if argument is ''FALSE'' and move him out of the track.

'''x''' and '''y''' collect the position of the train and close the result signal.

Unfortunately, I've found out a little bug in this scheme, too. At some times, it [[:File:en/Logic.and bug.png|jams]].
