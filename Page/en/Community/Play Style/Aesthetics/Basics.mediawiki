This section contains '''basic tips''' about aesthetic gameplay. Certain areas, such as railways, have pages of their own.

==General==
Adding aesthetic elements to your game is time consuming. You might consider changing the setting to allow all actions while paused.

When building an aesthetic station, three common needs are to make several different stations look like one big one, to combine multiple remote parts into one station, and to make stations bigger than the default 12x12 tiles. Joining stations, placing different stations on adjacent tiles, and connecting a remote tile to an existing station are done by holding the Ctrl-key (or your OS's equivalent) when you build. _Remote station joins_, as they are generally termed, also require the highlighted checkbox to be turned on. To build larger aesthetic stations a station spread of 20x20 tiles or more may be needed.

One of the central concepts of aesthetics in OpenTTD is realism. Providing passenger platforms at a coal mine alongside hill-busting tunnels and very closely spaced signals may produce more profit. Aesthetic players steer clear of these and prefer to use game elements which are much closer to real life.

==Building==
* Try to avoid 90° railway turns, because they look bad and non-realistic (you can turn it off in the "Advanced settings" menu).
