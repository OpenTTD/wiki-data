This section contains some '''examples''' of aesthetic styles of play, contributed by OpenTTD players.

Consider building electric railways with catenary on the outside of the tracks rather than the inside. This is generally how overheard wires are laid in most countries. Building in this way in OTTD will mean you can only build on certain tiles as the game dictates where the electric pylons are laid on each tile.

Consider avoiding bridges over rails/roads/rivers that are 'straight up and straight down'. Consider terraforming to create a more realistic look.
