The half cloverleaf is, as its name suggests, half of a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Cloverleaf]].  Trains have to do some looping.

===Pros===
*Can handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams not likely.

===Cons===
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope.
*Trains join the main line before leaving. This could cause traffic problems.
*Trains must turn left to go right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]]).

There is a modifed version of half cloverleaf that train do not need to turn left to go right.

===Tips===
*Make the loops bigger and without sharp turns.
*Make one of the loops go the other direction, so the train doesn't have to loop around.
*Make the branches bigger to hold a complete train, so trains that are waiting at a red signal aren't blocking other trains.
