The Pre-Signaled Roundabout is a combination of ideas. The primary idea is the [[en/Manual/Building depots]] which uses signals to give priority to trains travelling on the main lines. The second idea is your basic [[en/Community/Junctionary/Roundabout]]. One of the flaws of the Roundabout is that it can only handle 2 trains at a time. This slightly larger version can handle 4 trains. Additionally, trains turning right do not need to enter the Roundabout, instead passing by on the outer paths. So even if 4 trains are in the inner loop, other trains can still make right turns. The second flaw in a Basic Roundabout is that there is no preference given to exiting trains or entering trains. Using the Presignal Hack First described in [[en/Manual/Building depots]], we are able to give preference to trains exiting the loop. This greatly reduces the chance of a traffic jam. (I'm pretty sure the only condition that will cause a jam is four left turning trains entering the loop at exactly the same time.)

===Pros:===
*Traffic jams unlikely.
*Trains can use the junction to make a U-turn.
*No hills.
*Smaller footprint than most 4 way junctions. 
*Cheaper than other 4 way junctions.
*Simple to start, complexity added later.
 
===Cons:===
*Small chance of a traffic jam by large trains.
*Trains are still slowed by extra turns.
*Complex signals may be hard to get right.
*Large amount of larger trains cause traffic jams.

===Variations===

An additional benefit is that this is a junction that can be built very simple to start with, and then built up. For example, you can start with a square version of the basic Roundabout, and later on convert it into the Pre-Signaled version. This makes it very cheap to start with, and later when money is available the job can be completed.

This is a little harder to build, but seems to be easier to find room for.

This is easy to build.  A train can enter if and only if there is no trains on the two following steps.
It has been proven that no deadlocks (or traffic-jams) can occur. This verification has been done using Petri Nets. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trains.png]
