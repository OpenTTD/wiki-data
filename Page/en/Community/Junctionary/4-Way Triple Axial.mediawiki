*Handles a very large number of trains at a time.
*Uses special directions -> "Top vs Bottom" and "Left vs Right"
*Small Area needed (12x12) 
*Few sharp corners (see improved version for high speed)
*No Hills are needed (for extreme high speed)
*No Deadlocks or Jamming possible
*No Merging or Splitting of the lines
*Handling of single-lines and dual-lines possible. That's the reason no Splits or Merges are used. Do it by your own wishes.
*Each line starts one level higher when entering the junction than when leaving.
