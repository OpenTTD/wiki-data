'''The Crossover-Junction''' is a small junction which can handle a medium amount of traffic. It can be simply built over a mainline without changing too much of it. Only four connections to the mainline are made and the other line stops. To fix this two bridges are built over the original mainline and connected to the other line. A little further two bridges over the new line are made and connected so trains can turn round if they make a wrong turn.

'''Pros:'''
* Can handle a few trains.
* Doesn't take the train much time to clear.
* Not very difficult to remember.
* Relatively small.
* One of the main-lines is barely disturbed.

'''Cons:'''
* It is possible that a train needs to go up a bridge twice.
* It can be quite expensive.
* Many tight turns, depending on how large the junction is built.  Train speeds are restricted on the best part of the junction when it is built as small as the example above.
* Trains slow down when they go over bridges.
* Trains travelling from the South East are unable to exit to the North East. 
* Trains travelling from the North East are unable to exit to the North West
