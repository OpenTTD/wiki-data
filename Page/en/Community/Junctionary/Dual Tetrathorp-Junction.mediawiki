The '''Dual Tetrathorp Junction''' is a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Tetrathorp-Junction]] for double mainlines. It is ideally suited for mainlines at different height levels (in the following referred to as "Diff-Lev-Mains").

==Pros==
Putthrough:
* Tracks split before they merge, avoiding deadlocks.
* Can handle many trains at a time, Traffic jams are unlikely.

Speed:
* Turning trains have to go up and down (On "Diff-Lev-Mains": up OR down) a slope only once.
* No Bridges, no sharp [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#vehicle-speeds|bends]], allowing 132km/h everywhere.
* On "Diff-Lev-Mains", both mainlines have no slopes.
* Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Double Cloverleaf|double cloverleaf]].

Special Features:
* Turning lanes are natural (To turn left you just turn left), making [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] unnessesary.
* Turning lanes merge each other first and have a build-in load balancer before they merge the main line, allowing trains to go from inner lanes to outer lanes and vice versa, so that they can pick the new mainline with less traffic.
* Modular design: You can build the inner lanes first, with only little more space than the single [[en/Community/Junctionary/Tetrathorp-Junction]] and add the outer lanes later.

Building:
* Easier to remember and to build than the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Branch-Merge Junction|dual Branch-Merge]].

==Cons==
Puttrough:
* 10 6-long tunnels and 8 5-long tunnels. (Could be limited to 4-long tunnels by expanding the whole junction 3 tiles on both sides.)

Speed:
* On "Same-Lev-Mains", one pair of mainlines gets slopes, like on other split-before-merge junctions.
* On "Same-Lev-Mains", Trains have to go up and down slopes, like on other split-before-merge junctions.

Special Features:
* Requires the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|building on slopes]] patch to be enabled.

Building:
* Needs as much space as the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Branch-Merge Junction|dual Branch-Merge]], costs about 330k Pounds.
* Probably harder to remember than the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Double Cloverleaf|double cloverleaf]].

==Tips==
* Make the outer lanes for turning right longer, such that they can hold your longest train.
* Start building the inner single Tetrathorp and check if it works.

==Variations==
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Ttj flat.png|none|thumb|600px|Dual Tetrathorp for flat terrain]]
This Dual Tetrathorp junction is optimized for flat terrain.
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Ttj part.png|none|thumb|600px|Inner part of the Dual Tetrathorp]]
This is the inner single Terathorp (which is the same for the original junction and the flat variation). The outer landscaping is for the flat variation.
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Ttj exits.png|none|frame|Improved exits for the Dual Tetrathorp Junction]]
The load balancers of the above variations can be improved like this. The zigzagging exits keep trains from crossing the whole load balancer if their neighboring mainline is free. Additionally priority is given to the outer right-turning-lane(2) and to the mainlines (1 and 3).

==Technical Data==
* 40 free squares
* 38 tunnels
Cost of the flat variation:
* Landscaping: 59.592 Pounds
* Inner Tetrathorp: 134.138 Pounds
* Outer Tetrathorp: 132.462 Pounds
* Total: 326.984 Pounds
