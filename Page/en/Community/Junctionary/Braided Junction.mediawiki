The '''Braided Junction''' is optimized for compactness.

===Pros===
*Very compact
*No deadlocks since tracks split before they merge.
*No loops.

===Cons===
*The slopes and sharp turns make trains go slower.
*Signal distance is 7 tiles on straight track over the bridge.

===Variants===
Adding signals north and south of the bridge instead of using path-based signaling will make the crossing get a 5 tile signal distance on the straight track. The crossing will be slightly less compact.

This is a compact variant for a sideline junction.  Quite slow though:

And here is a compact variant for a mainline junction. Also quite slow:

This version is faster with straighter track. Better overall throughput with shorter tunnels and bridges:
