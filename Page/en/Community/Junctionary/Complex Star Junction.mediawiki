[[Translation:en/Community/Junctionary/Complex Star Junction]]
{{en/Community/Junctionary/Navigation}}
This junction was originally mislabeled as a '''Complex Roundabout''', or CRAB, even though there is no roundabout loop.  The tracks on split before they merge so trains are less likely to encounter a red signal. It does not give preference towards any track.

It is a complicated version of the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Star Junction]], with the branches very long and intertwined.  A larger Star junction will have the same effect.
