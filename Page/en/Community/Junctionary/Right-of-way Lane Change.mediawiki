{{en/Community/Junctionary/Navigation}}

For multi-lane networks with lots of traffic, sometimes you may want to let trains switch lanes.   If one lane backs up, trains can switch to another free lane.  However, the lane-switching train might cause a traffic jam behind it in the new lane!  With [[en/Manual/Signals]], you can make trains exiting the depot wait an opening in the 2nd lane before merging.

In the above picture, train A is stopped due to a jam further ahead.  Train B decides to go around it by switching lanes.  Train C comes and makes B have to wait to merge.  This allows B to not wait in the jam, but also not cause a jam in the 2nd lane.
