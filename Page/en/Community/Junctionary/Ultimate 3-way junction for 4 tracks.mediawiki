===Pros===
*Traffic jams unlikely.
*Can handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Trains that don't have to take make a turn can go past it.

===Cons===
*Some trains must slow down to climb a slope.
*Difficult to build correctly on the first try.
*Sharp turns slow trains down.
*Outer tracks have to run on a higher level than the inner two.
*Takes quite some space.
*Long bridges.

===Tips===
*Start by building the "short diagonal" track first.
*The first image above shows the junction without the bridges. Build this first and save the bridges for the last, otherwise you won't be able to see what you're doing.
