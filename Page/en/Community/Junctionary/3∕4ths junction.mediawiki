{{en/Community/Junctionary/Navigation}}
This junction is pretty easy to make, but is not complete and so trains can get lost.  Trains can go from NW to SW and SE to NE, but can not return.

{{en/Community/Junctionary/Junction Criteria|Cheap|1|2|2|2|1|0|1|1|0|0|0||Broken down trains affect at maximum 2 tracks. Example: On the southern right turn from SW to SE also the left turn from NW to NE is blocked (and the straight track from NW to SE, but that has at that point already joined the southern track).|
*Trains arriving from northeast or southwest are unable to turn left.
*Small
*Slope only in the one way of railway
*Useful for fast, serial construction
*Trains in line direction are not slowed, or slowed only a bit and are not blocked themselves
