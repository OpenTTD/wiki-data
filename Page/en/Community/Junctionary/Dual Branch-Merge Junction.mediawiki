'''The Dual Branch-Merge Junction''' is a high speed, high traffic junction. It branches at the beginning of the junction and merges right at the end, allowing more trains into the junction at once, thus preventing deadlock; it does not use sharp turns in order to maximize speed; it has a maximum of two slopes per path. Trains heading straight, turning right, or turning left all have dedicated tracks, which help alleviate traffic.

This junction works best with [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]] and if trains can choose between the inner and outer tracks just before entering the junction.

This junction is built for speed at the cost of space.





'''Pros:'''
*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams are unlikely.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a cloverleaf.
*Tracks split before they merge, avoiding traffic problems.


'''Cons:'''
*Trains have to slow down to climb slopes.
*Takes up a huge amount of space.
*Very complex and costly to build.
