===Bridge-based===
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Flyover.png|none|thumb|500px|High speed fly-over/under junction.]]
* Trains can travel at high speed.
* Can handle a huge amount of traffic.
* Can be used on a mainline.
* Area: 16 x 16

===Tunnel-based===
====Compact====
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Flyover tunnels compact.png|none|thumb|500px|High speed fly-over/under junction tunnels compact.]]

====Symmetric====
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Flyover tunnels symmetric.png|none|thumb|500px|High speed fly-over/under junction tunnels symmetric.]]
* Require the [[en/Manual/Sandbox options#tunnels-may-cross-each-other|tunnel cross]] cheat.

====Using 2-Layer tunnels====
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/High-speed 4WJ with 2-layer tunnels.jpeg|none|thumb|500px|High speed fly-over/under junction 2-layer tunnels symmetric.]]
* Using this method you don't need the [[en/Manual/Sandbox options#tunnels-may-cross-each-other|tunnel cross]] cheat anymore, but the deep tunnels are longer and the signal gap increases by 2 on that line

===A variation on this theme===
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/4way-junction-odisseus.png|none|thumb|500px|High speed fly-over/under junction variant.]]
* Each path has no more than one downward and upward slope
* The tightest turns are 1.5 tiles wide
* Area: 15x15

===A huge variation of the theme (only tunnels, no cheats)
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Openttd supreme 4-way junction.png|none|thumb|500px|Huge, high capacity, high speed fly-over/under junction.]]
Pros
* Hills: Yes
* Sharpest turn: 6.5 tiles wide
* Capacity: 50 6-tile trains
Cons
* Area: 52x52
* Cost: Expensive
