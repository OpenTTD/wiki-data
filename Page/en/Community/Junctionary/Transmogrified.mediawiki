In a '''Transmogrified Junction''' the entrances from north and south are connected in a central square with the exits to east and west, and vice versa for an outer square. There is a 3-way version called a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Half Transmogrified]] junction.

==Pros==
* Quite fast.
* Quite compact.
* Traffic jams are unlikely since tracks split before they merge.
* No loops.

==Cons==
* There are slopes on the straight tracks and at least half the turning tracks.

==Variations==

With a larger central square 7 wagons may fit between the turns on the slow path.

In this compact configuration the junction is very slow.

The incoming tracks are aligned with the outgoing. bridges are used instead of tunnels. Path-based signaling makes it possible for the outer bridges to be one tile shorter.
