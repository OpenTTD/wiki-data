===Pros===
*Can handle a large number of trains at a time. 
*Traffic jams are unlikely. 
*Main line is level and straight.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a half cloverleaf. 

===Cons===
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope. 
*Trains must turn right to turn left. Trains might get lost if [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] are not used.
*Costs much and requires moderately space to build.

===Tips===
*It's best you make it so your longest train can fit completely into one of the turning tracks without blocking the main line behind it.
