===Pros===
* Just 2 turns for direction change with enough space between them.
* Branch before merge
* Easy to build

===Cons===
* Branches have different length
* Takes up large amount of space
* Many bridges

===Improvement===

Using both bridges and tunnels, we can reduce the number of hills for the trains, so that each train has at most one up-hill.

==8-way improvement==

It can be build around an existing 4-way junction without major re-work, just add some bridges.

From higher altitude the layout is clear and lean.

Length is 28 titles, but that not that large for an 8-way junctions.
