This type of junction is good in the respect that it has a high capacity, but it's no good for hilly or cluttered areas because of the large amount of land it requires.

===Pros===
*Can handle 4+ trains at a time.
*Traffic jams are unlikely.
*Very easy to build
 
===Cons===
*Takes up a large amount of space when built without sharp corners.
*Can cause gridlock
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope and turn the corners.
*Trains must turn right to turn left. This could lead (although very rare) to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints]])

===Tips===
*Make the loops bigger, so there are no sharp turns.
*Make the loop and diagonal branches longer than your trains, so the main line is not blocked by a waiting train.
*Use tunnels if the bridges slow down your trains.
