This type of junction is good in the respect that it has a high capacity, but it's no good for hilly or cluttered areas because of the large amount of land it requires.

{{en/Community/Junctionary/Junction Criteria|Cheap|1|0|1|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|1|0|Broken down trains only affect the one track and left turns.|
*Can handle 4+ trains at a time.
*Takes up a large amount of space when built without sharp corners.
*Make the loop and diagonal branches longer than your trains, so the main line is not blocked by a waiting train.
*Use tunnels if the bridges slow down your trains.
*If necessary, upgrade to an [[en/Community/Junctionary/Tetrathorp-Junction|Over-Under junction]].
*Area: 10 x 10

*To be able to fully store a 12 length (6 grid spaces) train in each left turn movement, use a length of 2 for each side of the cloverleaf and start the cloverleaf 3 spaces away from the center intersection
*In general, the storage space of each cloverleaf is 7*n for a size n cloverleaf, where n is the length of each side in the leaf (start size n cloverleaf at 2*n-1 spaces away from the center intersection)
