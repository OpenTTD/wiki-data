<center>[[File:en/Big-two-to-four-roundabout.png|center|frame|Fig 2. Round-a-bout Second Version]]</center>

The second version of a round-a-bout has outer tracks that allows an inbound train to transfer to the next outbound track without entering the main inner round-a-bout track. This reduces the actual load on the round-about.

It also has a signal between each inbound and outbound track. This means that trains can still exit on the outbound track if the inbound switch is not clear; and conversly that an inbound train can enter if the outbound switch is block.

'''Pros:'''
*Cheap/Easy to Build.
*Compact size.
*Can handle several trains at a time
*Trains don't have to slow down to climb a slope.
 
'''Cons:'''
*Medium capacity.
*Can quickly cause traffic-jams.
