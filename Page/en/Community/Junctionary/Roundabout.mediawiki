===Roundabout with path based signals (PBS)===
Constructing a roundabout with PBS at its entries allows multiple trains to use the junction. Since there are no signals within the loop, deadlocks become impossible.

The goods train passes the junction from the upper right to the lower left corner. This does neither affect the passenger train (going from bottom-left to bottom-right) nor the cattle train (from lower to upper right).

*Low cost, low space consumption and relatively high efficiency}}

====Roundabout with PBS and bridges====
This slight modification allows crossing trains not to interfere with each other.

Without bridges, both the grain and steel train would go through the roundabout, causing one of both trains to wait for the other one to pass by. The additional paths for trains just going straight ahead increase the roundabout's efficiency even more, without need of additional space!

===Variations===
*When you make it bigger, you can create an 8-way roundabout

===Split Roundabout===

This modification allows trains to pass faster.
