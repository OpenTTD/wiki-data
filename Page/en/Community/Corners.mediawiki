[[Translation:en/Community/Corners]]
When using [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]], corners slow trains down a lot.  This page gives some basic advice about minimising the effects of corners.

=Basic Rules=

Trains suffer a speed limit when crossing more than one corner in the same direction at the same time.  Here are some examples:

[[File:en/Community/Corner-1x45.png|frame|left|no speed limit: only one corner]]
[[File:en/Community/Corner-2x45.png|frame|none|no speed limit: only one corner in each direction]]
[[File:en/Community/Corner-4x45-nocars.png|frame|left|no speed limit: train only ever touches one corner at once]]
[[File:en/Community/Corner-4x45.png|frame|none|speed limit!]]

=90 degree turns=

[[File:en/Community/Corner-90.png|frame|left|speed limit: 90 degree turn]]

Trains going round 90 degree turns are limited to 55kph (38mph).  There's a 
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles#forbid-trains-and-ships-to-take-90-deg-turns|setting]] to prevent 90&deg; turns altogether.

=Recommended distances between corners=

As a general rule, put at least as many squares between corners as the length of your longest station.  Trains take much longer to load and unload if they're longer than the station they're in, so trains longer than the longest station have bigger problems than speed limits.

Try to avoid building long diagonal track near towns, because this can limit [[en/Manual/Towns#growth|town growth]].  When you have to build diagonal tracks near towns, create tunnels at regular intervals underneath them.

If train length isn't an issue, you can calculate the distance you need between corners by comparing the fastest trains available with the [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#vehicle-speeds|table of speed limits]].  Here is a rough guide based on that information:

Note: Technically, the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/SH '125']] (also known as the BR 'IC125') wants 8 squares to turn, but it's not powerful enough to get up to full speed carrying that many wagons anyway.
