{{en/Warning|Savegames which are created with this branch might no longer work in subsequent versions. They will for sure not work in trunk, even after IS has been merged into trunk.<br>Also, please bear in mind that savegames from trunk might not work in the patched version}}

Infrastructure sharing is a patch in development from a few users.

Originally proposed and written by Gedemon it was subsequently maintained by a few other users [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=37455]. Currently there's a re-write in progress. Look at the tt-forums thread and post suggestions there or here ;) If you find problems, please always state the patch version or - if accessing the repo - the revision which you used.
