Help for vehicle console commands.

There are five commands that can be used to control vehicles. They all have same syntax, they just differ in which types of vehicles they affect and some subcommands work only on some vehicle types (for example selling train wagons work only with trains).

{|
|Command||Function
|-
|'''rail'''||Control trains (rail vehicles)
|-
|'''road'''||Control road vehicles (trucks, buses, trams)
|-
|'''ship'''||Control ships
|-
|'''aircraft'''||Control aircrafts (alias for this command is '''plane''')
|-
|'''vehicle'''||Control all types of vehicles

=== Synopsis ===

Command can be:
{|
|  center        ||  Center main view on vehicle's location (Aliases: centre)
|-
|  clone         ||  Clone vehicle, if it is in depot. Have no effect on vehicles outside depots. If parameter is specified, then that many clones are created. If not, only one clone is created.
|-
|  clone_shared  ||  Same as clone, but with shared orders.
|-
|  count         ||  Count vehicles matching given criteria. This command will do nothing, but you'll see how many vehicles are matched by the identifier
|-
|  depot         ||  Send vehicle to depot, unless it is in one already.
|-
|  ignore        ||  Ignore signals. Valid only for trains.
|-
|  info          ||  Show vehicle info on console. Some basic statistics like maximum speed, etc ... are printed to console for each matched vehicle.
|-
|  interval      ||  Set servicing interval. Parameter specifies new interval in days or in percent, according to what is set in patches configuration.

|-
|  skip          ||  Skip to next order. Optional parameter specifies how many orders to skip ('r' = skip to random order in the list, default is 1 - skip to next order).

Wagons are numbered from 1 (wagon number 0 is the first engine). Example: "wsell 3" will sell third wagon. "wsell 4 6" will sell wagons from 4th to 6th.
