== Configuring NewGRFs ==
When a player wants to pick a set of NewGRF for his game, (s)he encounters several problems which you can currently only solve with experience.
* You cannot see warning/errors/deactivation of GRFs before starting an actual game.
* You cannot see what GRF provides what game entities.
* You cannot tell whether the GRFs conflict in some trivial way, like
** certain cargos not being carried by any vehicles,
** cargos being produced while noone accepts them,
** cargos being required while noone produces them.
* Other GRF conflicts.

== Changing NewGRFs in game ==
When changing GRFs in game there are some additional issues:
* You cannot tell what stuff gets added or removed.
* You cannot tell what stuff is removed, but is actually required as there are instances of it on the map.
* You cannot tell what stuff is changed in an incompatible way.

== Configuring NewGRFs ==
Now, let's forget how the configuration works today; instead ask how it would work in Utopia?
* Players can already see what key features a GRF provides when choosing it from a list (automatically generated from the GRF content, not Action14 or similar), like
** industries,
** cargos,
** trains,
** road vehicles,
** trams,
** landscape,
** ...
* Players can open some window which displays details on the GRF, which items it provides, already in the main menu when selecting NewGRFs.
* Players see errors/warnings already when configuring the NewGRFs, they cannot start a game when a GRF would be disabled. This includes warnings depending on GRF parameters.
* Players can see compatibility warnings, like
** Towns need food in this climate, but there is no production chain producing it.
** There are no train vehicles available transporting "milk".
** There are no aircraft available in the starting year of your game.
** The last helicopter will expire around 2040.
** Set A provides new cargos, but set B is not compatible to any new cargos (it lacks a cargo translation table).
** Set A and B both provide conflicting cargo definitions.
** Both set A and B provide an industry called 'Power plant".
** ...

== Changing NewGRFs in game ==
How would Utopians deal with changing NewGRFs in game?
* They can see a summary of what is going to be added/changed/removed.
* They can see problems before applying the changes to the game.
* They can freely add additional GRFs, as long as they only provide additonal stuff. (That is already present GRFs do not conditionally removing stuff either.)
* They can remove GRFs which provide nothing that is being used. (Including stuff of other GRFs, which might get conditionally disabled.)
* They can replace GRFs with newer versions of the same GRF, which states to be compatible.
* They can change GRF parameters, which the GRF states to be changeable in game.
* They can remove GRFs which provide stuff present on the map, when they accept all of the present items to be automatically removed from the map.

= Borrowing stuff from Utopia =
== Current limitations ==
Currently OpenTTD can only load and activate a single NewGRF configuration (which is btw. also the reason, NewGRFs do not work in the intro game).
This is due to a lot of stuff being stored in global variables resp. NewGRF loading accessing global variables:
* There is only one pool for Engines, IndustrySpecs, SpriteGroups, Station classes, ...
* There is only one OverrideManager for industries, engines, ...
* Action 6/7/9/D can access variables of the game state (e.g. current year).
* Sprites are directly loaded into the sprite cache.
* There is even some kind of global pool for opened files.

If this would be proper C++, every spec loaded from a GRF would be a member of a NewGRF configuration class.
A gamestate would then reference an instance of this class, and retrieve all specs from it.
The class would also provide a strict interface between the specs and the game state, such as "current year".
However, this does not include interaction with items on the map. This shall only be about the stuff required to load some NewGRFs,
not to run the game.

So, what would need review / moving to some more strict interface?
* Pools for Specs may not be global variables.
* Overridemaangers may not be global variables.
* Action 6/7/9/D variables have to use some interface.
* Variables available in the "purchase lists" of vehicles, industries, objects need to use some interface.
* The fios and spritecache stuff needs to handle temporary loading/unloading of GRFs.
* ... yet unknown stuff ...

== What would be achievable ==
These changes would allow to test-activate the new NewGRF configuration in the main menu before starting a game
resp. in-game before applying it to the current game.
* Displaying Action B stuff in advance, including "feedback" when editing NewGRF parameters.
* Access to "purchase lists" of vehicles/industries resp. general lists of available stuff without an actual game. The lists could display everything, or on a per GRF basis.
* Detection of obvious compatiblity issues (as listed above in the Utopia section). (This could also be done with current OpenTTD, but only when starting a game)

== What would not be achievable ==
Checking for stuff being added or removed is considerable easy. A lot harder are changes to already existing stuff.
* Changes to vehicle length, while they are on the track.
* Railtype compatibility changes, while there are vehicles on the track.
* Industries producing different cargos resp. general changes in cargo acceptance.
* ...

== Summary ==
This is very hard, and a hell lot of work. But, it can be done in small steps. There should be no big step / transition somewhere in the process.
