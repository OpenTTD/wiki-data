'''Extended Generic Road Vehicle and Tram Set''' or '''eGRVTS''' is a [[en/Manual/NewGRF|newgrf]] vehicle set by Zephyris. eGRVTS provides an extended set of 218 generic road vehicles and trams, for all climates, in dual company colours. Includes vehicles from 1700 to 2075 with standard, express, double-decker, articulated, horse-drawn and steam vehicles. This set uses [[en/Manual/Refit]]ting and generic cargo classes, so may be used with any [[en/Archive/Manual/NewGRF Industries|new industry set]] (although some cargos may use generic graphics).

An simpler version of eGRVTS, [[en/Community/NewGRF/Generic Road Vehicle and Tram Set]], also exists which does not require the [[en/Vehicle pool]] for use.
