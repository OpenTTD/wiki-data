The '''Planeset''' is a [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] set available for [[en/Manual/Main Page]] and [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] which is drawn and coded by various people of the [[en/Transport Tycoon Forums]]. It features a vast array of new planes and helicopters.

The planeset is a popular set with OpenTTD, but has also often been incompatible, as OpenTTD lacks some of the NewGRF features it requires. A special version of the Planeset for OpenTTD was made, and several NewGRF patches were made for OpenTTD so users could enjoy features previously only available to users of the Patch. 

It features more realistic planes with real names and more variation in speed and capacity.
