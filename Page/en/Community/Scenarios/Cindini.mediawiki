This article aims to organize the work on Whopper's unfinished Cindini map ([http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=34368 TT-Forums Thread] / [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=30769&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0 Old TT-Forums Thread]). More details will follow soon.

== Introduction ==

For a short introduction and a little background information some quotes Whopper's [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=30769 forum post]:

''"During an internship in Africa I had to fill in many hours of free time on an ancient computer, so I had to find a game that didn't need a good computer and that could take you occupied for ages: so I downloaded good old TTD.''

''The only thing I always hated about TTD was that the infrastructure of cities was terrible and that a city always was nothing more then a big mess of streets and buildings put together. So I started making a Latin American/ Caribbean based map and tried to make the cities more realistic and real.''

''Unfortunately you can't customarily place buildings like in Locomotion so I needed to create the cities with a huge amount of placing roads deleting and expanding.''

''Now I am back home I unfortunately don't have the amount of time any more to finish the map but I hoped that someone might be interested in helping me out?"''


and


''"You really don't want to know how much time I spend on it, especially the big cities take a hugh amount op effort :-)''

''I would like help from people to finish it, because I know that if I am going to do the rest on my own with my current lack of free time that it will take ages. So if you are creative, have some knowledge about city infrastructure, enoug free time and would like to help finish this map, please mail me @ marijnheitkamp@gmail.com''

''It's on the largest map size of open TTD, the northern part is almost finished so I think it's about 40% done."''

== Design Rules ==
Because multiple persons are working on the map we have several "design rules" to ensure the map stays on a high quality.

=== Road types ===
Because openTTD doesn't include different types of road yet we are representing the importance of a road in other ways, in general we have the following three types of roads:

<center>[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Roadtypes.jpeg|center|frame| - Different roadtypes]]</center>

:;Regular road: The regular road is just the normal road that can be used anywhere, there are hardly any restrictions on how to make use of this type of road as long as they make sense. When building a road from one place to another bear in mind that they are not necessarily straight, so try to shape the road by its enviroment, instead of going through or over mountains or over cliffs try to let them go around those. Also try to make only 1 level of elevation behind eachother so instead of going straight to the top they will sway slowly up. When using bridges with the normal road types try to use cheap bridges instead of expensive ones. While playing on the map these curves and elevations will make a normal road less attractive then a highway or freeway.

:;Highway: Highways are important roads between cities or inside cities. The highway is a single road that is elevated 1 level higher than its surrounding. Inside cities you should try to not directly build buildings next to the highway but leave 1 block of space. Try to make the highway go as straight as possible without using too much elevation. Highways go through mountains or over cliffs instead of swaying around them. You can directly connect any regular road to the Highway but try to avoid to connect too many roads to a highway behind eachother.

:;Freeway: The freeways are the most important roads mostly connecting metropolises or large cities together or they are used in a ring around a metropolis. The freeway is a double road elevated 2 or more levels higher than its surrounding with both roads built on a slope making it normally impossible for any road to connect with it. To connect a freeway with a road, highway and other freeways you should use four connections from the specific road to the freeway like on the picture below. Freeways go as straight as possible, and have as little elevation as possible. Instead of changing the freeway to the terrain, change the terrain to suit the freeway. Inside large cities and metropolises sometimes double roads are used, but these are not freeways, freeways are always elevated and have special "ramps" which connect them to normal roads and highways.

=== Creating a city ===

<center>[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Tut city.gif|center|frame| - How to create a city in 3 steps]]</center>

:;Step1: Make a "global plan" for the city by placing the important roads (see the above picture), you can also place canals or roads on places that you plan to hold free from any buildings (like a park or the space beside a highway). In this case I built a single highway with some mayor side roads.

:;Step2: Actually place the city and expand it to the size that you find suitable.

:;Step3: Is the most time consuming step and can take up to several hours for metropolises. You have to clean up the city by deleting useless roads or illogical roads and expand/delete to get certain types of buildings into certain areas. For instance in this picture I tried to make some squares with high buildings around it while the rest of the city consist of luxury low level buildings. After making sure the buildings and roads are fixed I usually fill up the empty areas with trees and hills.

=== Creating a mountain range ===

<center>[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Tut mountain.gif|center|frame| - How to create a mountain range in 3 steps]]</center>

:;Step1: Make the shape of the mountain with the land generation tool.

:;Step2: Cover the elevated area with rocky ground.

:;Step3: Add trees: place lushy green trees around the mountains on the normal surface while placing the more sober trees on the mountain itself, placing them on plateaus and on some of the slopes.

=== Impiriata ===

:;Capital city: Capitola

:;History: After independence from europe, this country once spanned the entire western and southern part of Cindini including the sinzia freestate, large parts of Antia and the Ronian island group. In those times it was ruled by a violent dictator called Ricarneo who crowned himself “emperor of Cindini
