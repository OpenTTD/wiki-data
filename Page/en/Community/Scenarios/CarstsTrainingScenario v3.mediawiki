|description=Map information
* Training scenario, size 256x256, six towns, some industries.
* I used it to teach some friends how to play OpenTTD and they now love at as much as everyone here of us.
* Simple scenario, towns in 4 corners and 2 in the middle of the map, perfect for laying down some train tracks, flying from one corner to the next one, connecting the first industries.
* Map has some potential for PDA-versions of the game etc.
* '''NOTICE''': 4 GRFs installed => [[en/Community/NewGRF/DBSet|DB Set v0.82 (XL)]], [[en/Community/NewGRF/NewStations|NewStations v0.42]], PlaneSet and GermanTramSet. You should be able to play the scenario without these GRFs, but a message will show up that they are missing. Download all 4 of them: [http://www.carstenrau.de/diverses/openttd/grfs.zip Download]
* '''NOTICE2''': Scenario Download is a zip-file. You need to unzip it into your scnearios folder.<br>
