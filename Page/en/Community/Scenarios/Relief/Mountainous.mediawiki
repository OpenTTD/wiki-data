|description=The map has rough snowy mountains and deep valleys. So it should be a bit more challenging to build the infrastructure ;-) There are about 200 towns on the map, which is not that much compared to the map size. All towns are relativly small and towns above the snowline needs monthly food-service to grow. Towns and industries are not too close together. So at least in the early years some pre-planning is necessary to start an successful transport empire.
