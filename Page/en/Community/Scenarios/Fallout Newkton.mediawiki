|description=This is the first of a series of post-apocalyptic-themed maps featuring the Wasteland newgrf, among numerous others that I feel can add a lot to the map in the long run. I know the newgrf list is lengthy, but frankly I hate how few authors seem to be willing to include some of the quality content that is available out there with their scenarios. 
Anyway without further adieu, I present to you Newktown, otherwise known as New Keppington in a previous life, prior to the global war/demonic invasion/asteroid impact/your choice of other doomsday scenario appropriate to the end of this particular world. Several giant craters inhabit this once-thriving metropolis, where now only a few thousand survivors scavenge what they can off the remains of civilization. Surrounding the central city is a handful of tiny villages living off the irradiated foodstuffs still able to grow on the land and from what is probably severely mutated animals. Minerals, ore, gravel, and water are all available in various abandoned areas of the map, overgrown and relatively inaccessible. 
Keep in mind, no one appreciates the destruction of their property, so you'll find repurposing those fields and side-roads a dangerous proposition for future growth.
