|description=The North Island from Whangarei to the Nelson / Marlborough region of the top of the South Island. Hobbiton from the Lord of the Rings is the only imaginary town. There are very few power stations and only two oil refineries. In real life, the railway engineers had to construct the Raurimu rail spiral to limit too steep a grade - see http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/googlemap/2459
