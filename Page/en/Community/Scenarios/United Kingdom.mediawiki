|description=Map Information
* '''Geography'''
Approximately correct; Based off [[en/Manual/Heightmap|height map]] data from NASA; Placement of lighthouses bares no resemblance to real lighthouses; Major TV Masts are accurately placed
* '''Towns / Cities '''
Populations are approx real 2001 populations / 125; To be included population must be greater than 10,000 in the real world (equivalent to 80 in the game); Towns / Cities have been included on the following basis
* all cities (officially must be above 100,000)
* all towns over 60,000
* all other cities (under 100,000 but with a cathedral)
* all county towns (towns that originally gave the county its name)
* other towns of significance (usually geographically significant)
Populations are within 15% accuracy; Locations have been approximated using detailed terrain maps and relative positions; 197 towns in total
* '''Industry'''
The following industries have been based off maps of centres of UK industry
* Oil Rigs
* Oil Refineries
* Oil Wells
* Coal Mines
* Coal Power Stations
* Steel Plants
* Farms
* Forests
More than 1 of the same type of industry per town has been enabled to allow more realistic placement; Banks are in all towns big enough (1200 population); Factories are clustered around the major urban areas, particularly in northern England; Iron ore mines are located in Cumbria and Cornwall as these appear to be the only parts of the UK with significant quantities of iron ore
* '''General'''
Mainland Europe and Republic of / Northern Ireland are not yet populated with industries / towns; Some industry placement may need revising due to large distances; Cities become very large in later stages of game, may be better to start with real population / 250 (half current levels)
