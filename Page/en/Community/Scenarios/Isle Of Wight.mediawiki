|description= Isle Of Wight Scenario. Has all the main towns and small villages. Limited industries and mostly farms to reflect real siutuation. Also has some bigger towns on the mainland. You will need to download new grf in order to have the required grf for this to work. Please do not build bridges to the mainland as this will ruin the scenario.
