|description=The scenario is based on the height maps of Google Earth. So it is totally like it is in the real world. With Launceston in the north and Hobart in the south, makes it possible to set up a gigantic railway network.

With plenty of water supplies on the small deserts, and some farms on the higher plains, this scenario is really a true headache, for every strategist!

Some ideas to build:
*Passenger network from Launceston to Hobart
*Water network, from the deserts to any giant town
*Diamond network, from the small islands to the north to Hobart
*Oil/Food from the mountainous inlands to the coast, where the refineries are located
