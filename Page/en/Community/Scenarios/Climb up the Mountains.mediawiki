|description=This is one of the maps that are quite old. It was made in the late 90s with TTD. So it could be played with any version of [http://www.openttd.org OpenTTD] and  [http://www.ttdpatch.net TTDPatch] and even with TTD. The map is divided in two main parts. The south western area is somewhat flat where on the other side the north eastern part has very high mountains.
