|description=Another TTD map from the late 90s that is playable with any version of [http://www.openttd.org OpenTTD] and  [http://www.ttdpatch.net TTDPatch] and TTD itself, of course. The map has lots of little and medium sized lakes which might make it interesting for ship transport if you build some canals and locks. Most of the landscape is flat with a few hills. Only in the south eastern part of the map is high mountain range.
