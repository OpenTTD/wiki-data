|description=This is a map of New Zealands Chatham Islands. Only the terrain is real as I checked the island and there is only one small town on it and no visible industries. The best part and most profiting is a small island to the south of the large island where there are a lot of diamond and copper ore mines with high production rates but there are no industries there that would accept those materials and the island is a fair way away from the big one so you'll have to earn quite some money before you can tap the resources there, ships may or may not be a good choice, use your imagination ;)
