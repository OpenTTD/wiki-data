== Files from TTD ==
OpenTTD requires the following original game files from your Transport Tycoon Deluxe installation CD. The following files are mandatory. You need to copy them to the data/ directory, which is in your OpenTTD directory. These files contain the grapics and the sound effects:
* trg1r.grf
* trgcr.grf
* trghr.grf
* trgir.grf
* trgtr.grf
* sample.cat

Additionally, you may want to copy the original game music. To accomplish that, you need to copy the /gm/ folder from the TTD CD to your OpenTTD directory (don't put it in the data/ dir!).

There are a few ways to get these files:
* Copy the folder and files from the TTD game CD to your openttd/ folder.
* Unzip a TTD installation zip file, and copy the folders.
* Install TTD for Windows on another partition and then copy the folders.
