=Introduction=
Since version 1.0.0 of OpenTTD, installation is simplified significantly and the game is completely open source (including both the game and graphics); everything is included in the installer. To download the latest version of OpenTTD [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable click here].

Installation can be a little complicated, as the [[en/Archive/Community/Base graphics]] are not distributed with the game. So besides [http://www.openttd.org/ downloading the game], you need to obtain a set of base graphics as well.

Currently, there are two sets of base graphics that OpenTTD can use:
* [[en/Basesets/OpenGFX]], the official [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source open source] graphics set made by the OpenTTD team.
* The original base graphics from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon Transport Tycoon Deluxe] (TTD) CD. As opposed to OpenTTD, TTD is '''not''' free software.

= Installation =
'''Select the installation instructions for the base graphics set you chose and your operating system:'''
:<p style="font-size: 90%">''If you have access to the TTD base graphics and can't decide what base graphics to use, install the game using the TTD base graphics. OpenGFX can easily be installed afterwards. However, the easiest way is to install the game with all files from the start: TTD base graphics, [[en/Basesets/OpenGFX]], [[en/Basesets/OpenMSX]] and [[en/Basesets/OpenSFX]] files.''</p>

== Installation on Windows ==

 Win XP : "C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents\OpenTTD"
 Vista  : "C:\Users\<username>\Documents\OpenTTD"
 Linux  : "~/.openttd"
:'''4.2.''' Open [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] using your favourite plain text editor.

:'''4.4.''' Save the changes you made and run OpenTTD.


== Installation on macOS ==
 
'''1''' Get the macOS download for OpenTTD from the [https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest downloads page]. The .dmg disk image is the recommended choice. A .zip archive may also be available.

'''2''' Open the .dmg disk image or .zip archive from the download.

'''3''' Create an '''OpenTTD''' folder on your computer, and copy the files to it from the disk image or zip archive.

'''4''' OpenTTD requires some additional graphics file, for which there are two choices: original TTD base graphics, or OpenGFX. 

Using original TTD base graphics
# Get Transport Tycoon Deluxe for Windows or DOS. If you don't have your CD, see [http://www.google.com/search?q=transport+tycoon+deluxe Google]. '''Note''': The original graphics are '''copyrighted''', it may be illegal (in some countries) to download them.
## see [[#files-from-ttd|below]] for what files need to go where.

Using OpenGFX base graphics
# Consult the [[en/Archive/Community/OpenGFX Readme#manually-installing-opengfx|OpenGFX Readme]] for further instructions.

'''5''' Run OpenTTD.

== Installation on Linux ==

#Within Software Center of your distribution (or Package Manager), pick OpenTTD
#Click install

=== Install Manually ===
#Head to the [https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest downloads page] and under Download Stable select <code>openttd-##.#-linux</code> from the drop down. 
#Download the Linux Generic Binaries (x86_64, 64bit) (xz/lzma archive) to your computer. 
#Open your terminal and navigate to where the archive was downloaded. 
#Create the OpenTTD folder <code>sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/openttd</code>
#Extract the contents from the terminal <code>sudo tar -xvJf openttd-##.#-linux-generic-amd64.tar.xz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/share/openttd</code>
#Copy the Share folder inside your new openttd folder to your system's share folder. <code>sudo cp -Tr /usr/share/openttd/share /usr</code>
#Open the <code>openttd.desktop</code> file in your terminal text editor of choice. <code>sudo nano /usr/share/applications/openttd.desktop</code>
#Under the line that says, <code>Exec=openttd</code> add the line <code>Path=/usr/share/openttd/</code> and save the file.
#Finally, copy the <code>openttd.desktop</code> file to <code>/usr/share/applications</code>: <code>cp /usr/share/openttd/share/applications/openttd.desktop /usr/share/applications/</code>

Now OpenTTD will appear where other installed apps appear on your system. For Ubuntu you'll see OpenTTD in the "Show Apps" menu. You'll be able to pin the application to the dash as well.

You can now choose either OpenGFX graphics, or use the original TTD graphics if you have a copy of original game.
OpenGFX is faster and preferred.

===Choosing OpenGFX for base graphics===
#Start the game.
#In game main menu, go to Check Online Options.
#Check OpenGFX, OpenMSX, OpenSFX; press download and close the window.
#In the game's main menu, select Settings and make sure you are using the three packs above.
#Play.

===Choosing TTD for base graphics===
#Get Transport Tycoon Deluxe for Windows or DOS.  
* If you don't have your CD, see [http://www.google.com/search?q=transport+tycoon+deluxe Google]. 
*'''Note''': The original graphics are '''copyrighted''', it may be illegal (in USA and some countries) to download them.
#Create an '''~/.openttd/''' directory and put them there.

== Manual Installation from source on Linux ==
See [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on GNU∕Linux and 🟉BSD]].

= Files from TTD=
If you're installing OpenTTD with the TTD base graphics, OpenTTD requires several original game files from your Transport Tycoon Deluxe installation CD.

The following files are mandatory. You need to copy them to the /baseset directory, which is in your personal OpenTTD directory. These files contain the graphics and the sound effects:
* trg1r.grf
* trgcr.grf
* trghr.grf
* trgir.grf
* trgtr.grf
* sample.cat


Additionally, you may want to copy the original game music. To do that, you need to copy the /gm/ folder from the TTD CD to your personal OpenTTD directory.


There are a few ways to get these files:
* Copy the folder and files from the TTD game CD to your OpenTTD /data folder.
* Unzip a TTD installation zip file, and copy the folders.
* Install TTD for Windows in another directory and then copy the folders.

= Installing sound and music =
Chances are, your OpenTTD installation already has sound and music. If it doesn't, we recommend you install [[en/Basesets/OpenSFX]] and [[en/Basesets/OpenMSX]] from the in-game content downloader. You need an internet connection for this. After downloading, go to “Game Settings” and select these base sets for sounds and music.

For music to work, your system needs to have MIDI playback support. Most systems should support it out of the box, but if not, consult the manual of your operating system to learn how to get MIDI support.

You can control music and sound playback in-game with the Sound/Music menu. Click the “Play” button to start music playback.

= Installing AI =
AI is necessary in order to get competing companies in singleplayer. Without AI, the computer won't launch any competing companies, and your company will be alone.

In the main menu, click on the “AI Settings” button, and then on “Check online content”. Again, you need an internet connection for this to work. There are a lot of AIs to choose from. We recommend SimpleAI for a start, as it is the most stable one. In the AI menu, you can choose how many computer players there will be in your game.
