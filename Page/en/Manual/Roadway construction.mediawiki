Roadways make for a good starting network as they are quick, cheap, and easy to build.  A roadway network will not be as profitable as a good railway network.  However, [[en/Manual/Feeder service]]s built out of roadways can effectively complement a train network.

===Types of roadways===
To select which type of roadway to build, click and hold the roadway build button in the main menu.
[[File:en/Manual/Roadmenu.png|none|frame|Choose road type]]
* Normal roads - [[en/Manual/Road vehicles]]s and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Buses|buses]] run on this roadway.
* [[en/Manual/Tramways]] - [[en/Manual/Tramways]]s run on this roadway.
* Dual purpose roadway - Allows travel of trucks, buses and trams.  Build a tramway line on top of a road to make this type.

==Building road vehicles==
To build a [[en/Manual/Road vehicles|road vehicle]], place a [[en/Manual/Depots]] and then click it. You will be presented with the depot window. Select "Build new vehicles" and a new window will pop up with a list of vehicles. Select one and click "Buy Vehicle" at the bottom of this window. The vehicle will appear in the depot window and the vehicle's control window will open. Give it orders or refit it as necessary, then click on the red "Stopped" button to get it rolling!

==Building Trams==
To build a [[en/Manual/Tramways]], first ensure you have some tram vehicle GRF files installed. Then, place a Tramway depot, construct a vehicle by clicking ''New Vehicles'', then select a vehicle and purchase it. It will be then placed into the depot and its vehicle window will be opened. Issue [[en/Manual/Orders]] to it, and click on the bottom bar marked "Stopped" to start the Tram. Trams can only turn around at rail end.

==Building one-way roads==
[[File:en/Manual/Oneways.png|left|frame|All possible One-Way roads]]
[[File:en/Manual/Oneway.png|right|frame|The sign with the arrow is the one-way build button]]

One-way roads are build by using the normal road build tools and clicking on the one-way road button. Roads will then be one-way in the direction they are dragged. One-way roads may also be built over previously built roads, but only if they are player-owned. Only the entrance tile to a stretch of roads needs to be one-way. Blocking tiles are built by dragging one way to build, then dragging over the other way.

The image shows all the possible roads. The first two show the one-way in the specific directions. The third one is a both-one-way road or to be more specific, it's a blocking tile. No vehicle can cross it (as the grf shows). The last one is the default road without any one-way direction. One-way bridges are not possible (yet?).

Trams ignore whether the road is one-way or blocking. They'll always run over it in both ways.
