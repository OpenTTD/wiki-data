__TOC__
After a bit of tycooning you start to realise that a separate rail for each and every train is not as efficient and beautiful as you thought. You start to bundle rails that go to the same place, and try to run more trains over them. Pretty soon you just know that you need signals to increase the throughput of your rail network.

==Placing Signals==
The first thing to do is to select the [[en/Manual/Railway construction|railway construction]] toolbar and there, click on the ''signals'' icon. This will turn your mouse cursor into a ''signal placement'' icon, as can be seen below in Fig 1. The ''signals'' button, the universal ''clear'' button, which we will use to remove signals, and the '''"CTRL"''' key (more about that later), will be your best friends here. Now we can start laying down signals.

Once you have selected a suitable piece of track to add signals to, grab your mouse, and click once on your railway. A '''two-way''' signal will appear. Clicking again and again on the same tile with signals, they will toggle between the three types: '''two-way''', '''one-way''' right side, and '''one-way''' left side. Pressing '''"CTRL"''' when signals are already present will toggle these signals between '''pre-signal''', '''exit-signal''', '''combo-signal''', and back to normal ones. More explanation on these special type of signals can be found at the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Advanced signalling examples]] page.<br />
If you do the same placement of signals on an empty piece of track, but now with '''"CTRL"''' pressed, ''semaphores'' will be placed. These are old-style signals. They work the same, have the same modifiers as above, the only change is their looks.


So in short:
*Putting signals on empty tracks will cause them to be built on both sides. With the '''"CTRL"''' button, you can choose between signals and semaphores.
*Clicking the signals cursor on a piece of track already signalled will toggle them between two-way and one-way signals.
*Clicking the signals cursor with '''"CTRL"''' on a piece of track already signalled, will toggle those signals/semaphores between pre-, exit-, and combo-signals.

==I don't want to click a zillion times to signal my track!==
One of the most annoying and RSI-prone activities in TTD(Patch) was the laying of signals one by one, over a large straight piece of track. Especially annoying were the horizontal/vertical [[en/Manual/Building tracks|building of tracks]], since you couldn't drag those. Thankfully, ''Autorail'' has fixed that issue. Now, with ''Autosignal'' you have the same power at your fingertips!

Just do as in Fig 2 below: hold down the left mousebutton at the piece of track where you want to start signalling, and drag all the way to the end of your desired area. To set the distance between the signals, use the option called ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Drag signal density]]'' in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|configure patches -> construction]] window. Setting this to 3 for example, will only place a signal every three tiles when using ''Autosignal''.


Now there are a few things to keep in mind:
*When dragging with '''"CTRL"''', semaphores will be placed.
*Dragging signals will always signal your selection with '''two-way''' signals.
*To signal an area with one way signals, first build one signal, and set it to your desired look. Then start dragging with that signal as the first one. Its style will be copied to all following tiles. <warning>Pre-, exit-, and combo-signal settings will '''NOT''' be copied</warning>, these are only used in front of stations or big junctions.
*The above also means that existing pre-, exit- and combo-signal combinations will be left alone and not changed when dragging over them.
*With the "copy first signal" behaviour, you can also rearrange an already existing stretch of signals. They will have the same layout as the ''"master"'' signal (the first one). This also means that when you start from an empty-signal piece, its style, '''two-way''' will be copied.
*It is possible to "convert" signals to semaphores and vice-versa. Just make sure your ''"master"'' tile is of a different type. You will be charged for removing the old signal, and putting up the new type.
*All dragging, converting, copying, etc. will occur at the signal density specified in the patch setting.
