'''[[en/Manual/Signals]]''' are used to direct your trains and prevent railway crashes.

This tutorial is designed to give a basic introduction to signalling. For in depth information on the different signal types and applications, see [[en/Manual/Signals]].
__TOC__
== Constructing a signal ==
#Click the '''Build railway track''' [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] button on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#the-menu-bar|menu bar]] to display the Railway Construction toolbar:<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|none|frame|The Railway Construction toolbar]]
#Click the '''Build railway signals''' [[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] button from the Railway Construction toolbar to display the Signal Selection toolbar:<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Signal Selection.png|none|frame|The Signal Selection toolbar]]This toolbar is fairly simple to navigate. The top row has semaphore signals, and the bottom row has light signals. Each signal type is functionally identical to the one above/below it, so choose the signal you wish to give the desired look you want for your railway.<br/>From left to right on this toolbar, the signal types are block signal, entry signal, exit signal, combo signal, path signal, and one-way path signal. If at any time you are unsure as to which signal is which or you want to know more about each signal's purpose, you can '''hold right-click on the button''' in the Signal Selection toolbar and a tooltip will be displayed giving you more information.
#Once you have selected a signal type, '''position your cursor over the railway tracks''', where you wish to build your signal.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial2.png|none|frame]]
#'''Click once''' to construct a signal on the track. ''Unless you chose a path signal'', you will build a '''two-way signal'''. Path signals always face one direction only.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Two-way signal.png|frame|left]][[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial3.png|none|frame]]
#'''Click again''' to convert your signal to a '''one-way signal'''. Now, unless you have built a standard path signal, only trains coming from the direction the signal faces will be able to pass it. All signal direction alterations are free of charge.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/One-way signal.png|frame|left]][[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial4.png|none|frame]]
#'''Click again''' to convert the signal to face the opposite direction.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial5.png|none|frame]]
#'''Click again''' to convert your signal back to a '''two-way signal''' again.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial5b.png|none|frame]]

== Constructing a line of signals ==
You can also build several signals of the same type at once by clicking and dragging along the section of track you want signals built on. However you may find it more useful to click and drag from an existing signal, as doing so will construct a line of signals facing the same direction:
#While the '''Build railway signals''' [[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] tool is selected, '''position your cursor over an existing signal'''.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial4.png|none|frame]]
#'''Click and drag''' the mouse along the railway track. <b>Note:</b> when holding ctrl preforming this action the whole track wil automaticaly been given this type of signals.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial20.png|none|frame]]
#'''Release the mouse''' to place the signals.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial21.png|none|frame]]

Depending on the value displayed on the '''Dragging signal density''' [[File:en/Manual/Signal Density.png]] button on the Signal Selection toolbar, signals will be placed every N game tiles (the default value for N is 4) when constructing a line of signals this way.

You may change the dragging signal density by clicking the small arrows on the button. Also note that if you click and drag from entry, exit or combo signals, this method will construct block signals facing the same direction.

== Removing signals ==
You can remove existing signals by clicking the '''Bulldozer''' [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]] button on the Railway Construction toolbar, while having the Signal Selection toolbar open.

The white square will change to a red square. Then you may click on individual signals to remove them or click and drag along a section of track to remove a line of signals. Click the tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' key shortcut.

This tool obeys the value displayed on the '''Dragging signal density'''[[File:en/Manual/Signal Density.png]] button on the Signal Selection toolbar.

== Signal types ==
There are basically three types of signals: [[en/Manual/Signals#block-signals|block signals]], [[en/Manual/Signals#pre-signals|presignals]] and [[en/Manual/Signals#path-signals|path signals]]. Presignals are a special kind of block signal.

'''Block signals''' only allow one train at a time in a signal block, while path signals consider where trains want to go and allow multiple trains in a signal block when possible. A signal block is an interconnected piece of tracks enclosed by signals: the signals separate the signal blocks. If there is no signal between two sections of track, both sections are in the same signal block (and allow only one train in case of block signals). Note that trains need not necessarily be able to travel between all sections of a signal block: as long as the tracks are somehow connected without an intermediate signal, they are in one single block.

Normal block signals are the easiest to use. They can be both one-way and two-way (click to build a two-way signal, click again on the same tile to change to one-way, click again to change the direction, click again for two-way). One-way block signals can only be passed by trains "driving towards the light" and are an easy way to set up one-way tracks. Be careful with two-way block signals; if two trains approach this type of signal from both sides they may get stuck and cause a [[en/Manual/Deadlock]].

'''Path signals''' come in two flavours: one-way and two-way. With both types, trains can only stop at the signal when driving towards the light. The one-way path signals (with the red and white sign) cannot be passed from the back side. The two-way path signals can be passed from the back, but trains will always continue to drive past the signal. Key to using path signals is to make sure that every signal allows a train to wait without blocking an intersection. So when placing a path signal, imagine your longest train waiting at the signal and work out if it would block something; if so, the signal is in the wrong place.

If you're new to OpenTTD, path signals are the easiest to use, as you can build stations and intersections without much problems. Just make sure you keep the "rule" as explained above in the back of your head. Normal block signals can be used on very easy setups with only two trains or on long uninterupted one-way track sections. '''Presignals''' are more complicated and will not be explained for the purpose of this tutorial. More details about all types of signals, including examples, can be found in the [[en/Manual/Signals]] section of the manual.

== Converting signals to different types ==
You can convert an existing signal to a different signal type by clicking the '''Signal Convert''' [[File:en/Manual/Signal Convert.png]] button on the Signal Selection toolbar. Then, when you click on an existing signal it will be converted free of charge to the signal type selected in the Signal Selection toolbar.

To turn signal conversion off (if you want to return to constructing signals), click the Signal Convert button again.

Holding the CTRL key while clicking on a signal (with signal conversion off) toggles the signal through the available signal types.

Holding the CTRL key while clicking on a signal (with signal conversion on) changes the style of a signal (semaphores/ modern signals) to the signal style selected in the Signal Selection toolbar. This will however cost money.
