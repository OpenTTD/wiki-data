'''Trams''' are a feature  that allows you to construct [[en/Manual/Tramways]], which can be built on open ground and on existing road systems. The default tram infastructure graphics are provided by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]]. To play with trams, you need an active tram vehicle [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]. As with other transportation systems, trams require their own infrastructure, including [[en/Manual/Depots]].

===Types of roadways===
To select which type of roadway to build, click and hold the roadway build button in the main menu.
[[File:en/Manual/Tramwaymenu.png|none|frame|Choose Tramway construction]]
* [[en/Manual/Roadway construction|Normal roads]] - [[en/Manual/Road vehicles]]s and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Buses|buses]] run on this roadway.
* Tramways - Trams run on this roadway.
* Dual purpose roadway - Allows travel of trucks, buses and trams.  Build a tramway line on top of a road to make this type.

==Availability==
Due to this being a relatively new feature in OpenTTD and [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], there are not many tram vehicle GRFs yet fully completed. There are however, a few pre-release or test versions which can be found listed on the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page]] or [http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/index.php?do=list&cid=105 GRF Crawler]. Please also look through [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=26 TT-Forums] for tram vehicle sets.

To build a tram, first ensure you have some tram vehicle [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] files '''installed and actived:'''
*'''To install:''' Use the ''"Check Online Content"'' button of the main display; you type ''tag/name filter:'' '''tram'''; you tag your desired files NewGRF and download it.
:[[File:en/Manual/Tramways install.png|none|frame|To install NewGRF files.]]
*'''To activate:''' Use the ''"NewGRF Settings"'' button of the main display and the ''NewGRF Settings'' window appear with the ''Activate NewGRF files'' on top, to add news files, select these from the ''Inactive NewGRF files'' list and press ''"Add"''.''

Besides building on flat land roads, depots and stations can also be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|built on slopes]].

When laying tracks keep in mind that tramway cars need terminal loops to turn around and drive back. A terminal loop is built by laying a half tile of track. Although the loop seems to cover the whole tile on the map it's just a half tile internally. The half tile is always at the open end, i.e. oposite from the round end. This is important if you want to remove single track pieces. Laying more than one piece of track on a tile creates straight or curved track or a crossing and doesn't allow turning around.

==Building Trams==
Then, place a Tramway depot, construct a vehicle by clicking ''New Vehicles'', then select a vehicle and purchase it. It will be then placed into the depot and its vehicle window will be opened. Issue [[en/Manual/Orders]] to it, and click on the bottom bar marked "Stopped" to start the Tram.
