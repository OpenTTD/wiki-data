'''Goods''' is the collective term that refers to useful manufactured products delivered to the inhabitants of your towns and cities, including (but not limited to) furniture, vehicles, food products ([[en/Manual/Climates]] only, an independent type of cargo, [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]], is used for [[en/Manual/Climates]] and [[en/Manual/Climates]] climates), books, plastic items and petrochemical products.

It is a lucrative cargo, more so the sooner the player can deliver it.  Goods are also known to encourage town growth.
