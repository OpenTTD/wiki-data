Diamonds is only availible in the sub-tropical climate. It is produced by gold-mines and must transportet to banks. In the sub-tropical climate the banks do not produce valuable-bags.

== Strategies ==
Maybe it is a good strategie to transport diamonds by airplane. Airplanes are really fast and so the payment rate is high. But ypu will need big airplanes to do so, at least airplanes for 150 passengers. The banks are located in towns, so it maybe difficult to build an airport near them.

Using feeder systems can solve this problem. The airports near the towns can be dual used by gold-transports and passanger-services, if they have enough capacity.

There are only two airports per town allowed. This means, if you build many airports near diamonds-mines and banks you competitors cannot build so many airports. So on maps with few towns, you prevent that they start many airlines.
