'''Livestock''' are farm animals like cows, sheep, pigs and maybe goats. In the case of a temperate climate, they are transported from a farm to a factory where they are made into "[[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]]", i.e. meat products, ready to be taken to shops. In the case of a sub-arctic climate, they are instead taken to a food processing plant that makes "[[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]]" out of them.
