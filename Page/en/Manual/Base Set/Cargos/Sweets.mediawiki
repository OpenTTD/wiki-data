'''Sweets''' is a cargo found in [[en/Manual/Climates]] only.  It's one of the toyland cargos that have more readily sources and better recipient range.  Sweets can be produced from any of the following:  [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Sugar]], [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Toffee]] or [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Candyfloss]], and are transported to town houses.

Sweets correspond to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]] in [[en/Manual/Climates]] and [[en/Manual/Climates]] climates, and their logistics are almost identical.  For its convenience, sweets should be considered to be part of the frieght backbone in Toyland climate games.
