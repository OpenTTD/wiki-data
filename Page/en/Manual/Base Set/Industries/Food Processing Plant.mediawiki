The '''Food Processing Plant''' is responsible for producing [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]]. In [[en/Manual/Climates|sub-arctic climates]] it needs [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Livestock]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Wheat]], in [[en/Manual/Climates|sub-tropic climates]] it is best to deliver both [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Fruit]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Maize]].

Food from the plant is required in both climates to grow [[en/Manual/Towns]] beyond their initial size, though only towns above the snow-line (sub-arctic) or in deserts (sub-tropical) are affected. The latter ones also want additional [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]] for growth.
