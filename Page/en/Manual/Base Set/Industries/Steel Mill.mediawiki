The '''steel mill''' is a large complex of furnaces and channels of molten [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Steel]]. It produces the steel from [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Iron Ore]] which is delivered by a transport company.

The steelmaking process is sufficiently interesting that the mill can in fact become a tourist attraction if you place a passenger station close enough.  That is, it will accept [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]] if enough of the industry is within the catchment area of the station.

Steel Mills are only available in the Temperate climate, since in other climates iron ore is not available.
