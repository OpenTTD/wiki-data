The '''Sawmill''' turns [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Wood]] into [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]], probably an allude to wood furniture or paper goods.

Although wood is available in all three real-life climates, the '''Sawmill''' is only available in [[en/Manual/Climates]]:
* The sub-arctic climate inserted the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Paper Mill]] and the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Paper]] cargo (which somewhat resembles [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Steel]] in temperate) in the middle, therefore wood is not converted directly into goods there.
* Wood (produced by [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Lumber Mill|lumber mills]]) in sub-tropical climate is processed in [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Factory|factories]].
