The '''Oil Rig''' produces [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Oil]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]]; it also accepts Passengers and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Mail]] as cargo. Being the only industry (not counting game-changing [[en/Manual/NewGRF|NewGRFs]]) that is constructed entirely on water, it is also ''only'' found in the temperate climate. Rigs don't appear until year 1960.

Another specialty about the Oil Rig is that it is a neutral station complete with built-in [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles|dock]] for [[en/Manual/Ships|ships]] and helipad for [[en/Manual/Aircraft|helicopters]]. Every [[en/Manual/Transport company|company]] can transport to and from these facilities as soon as its construction is finished.

If one company transfers cargo to a rig's neutral station, a second company may pick up the cargo. This causes the first company to lose the payment for the cargo, because the entire payment goes to the company that makes the final delivery.
