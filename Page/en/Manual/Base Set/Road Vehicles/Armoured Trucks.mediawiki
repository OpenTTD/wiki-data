[[Translation:en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Armoured Trucks]]

NOTE: These vehicles perform a different function in each climate.
*In "temperate" they transport valuables between banks (which are built in cities of over 1,200 population).
*In "sub-arctic", they carry gold from gold mines to banks(no population requirements here).
*Finally, in "tropical" climate, they carry diamonds from diamond mines to banks.
Oh yes, apart from the type of cargo, the statistics remain the same.
