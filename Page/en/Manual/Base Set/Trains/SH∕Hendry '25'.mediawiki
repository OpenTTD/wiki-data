|Description=This is the first diesel engine capable of pulling heavy loads. It is weaker than the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/UU '37']]; hardly better than the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Ginzu 'A4']] and inferior to the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/SH '8P']]. It is best used for light or medium loads, filling the role of a "secondary workhorse", which the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Chaney 'Jubilee']] had in the beginning of the game.
