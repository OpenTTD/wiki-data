|Description=The MJS250 is the first diesel powered engine available in [[en/Manual/Climates#sub-arctic|sub-arctic]] and [[en/Manual/Climates#sub-tropical|sub-tropical]] climates. It is cheap but lacks speed and power. Upgrade away from these as soon as time and money permit it. However, a multiheaded engine out of two MJS250s will be cheaper and more powerful than a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Wills 2-8-0]].
|Real-life=The MJS250 resembles the Davenport 44t switcher.}}
