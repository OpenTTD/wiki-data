|Description=Even with some reliability issues, this engine provides a substantial improvement over Monorail.

Not only does it feature a 20% increase in top speed compared to the Millennium Z1, thanks to the Maglev tracks it's also able to pull very long and heavy trains.
|Real-life=No Real-Life Equivalent has been found for this train. Perhaps in a few years, when MagLev has become a real technology, you could fill in a First-Generation MagLev engine here.
