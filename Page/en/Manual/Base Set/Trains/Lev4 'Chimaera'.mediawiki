|Real-life=No Real-Life Equivalent has been found for this train. Perhaps in a few years, when MagLev has become a real technology, you could fill in a Fourth-Generation MagLev engine here. The train does resemble the [http://www.transrapid.de Transrapid] 9(?) trains.

As the only multi-headed maglev locomotive, "Chimaera" is a good name for it!
