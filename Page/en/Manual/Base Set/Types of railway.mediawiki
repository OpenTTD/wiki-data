The types of track are as follows:

==Normal railway==

[[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways]] are the only railway available at the start of the game (unless the game is started at a very early date). Only steam and diesel trains run on this railway (unless the Electric Rails patch is disabled).

==Electrified railway==

[[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways]] become available in 1965. Electric trains will run ''only'' on this type of track, unless you disable Electric Railways in the patch settings. Steam and diesel trains can still run on this railway.

==Monorail==

[[en/Manual/Base Set/MagLev|MagLev]] is the final rail type, allowing the fastest trains and only becoming available in 2022. Only MagLev trains can run on this railway.
