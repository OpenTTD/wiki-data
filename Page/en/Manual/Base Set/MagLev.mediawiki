'''MagLev''' is the English abbreviation for "magnetic levitation", which is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev existing technology] (though not really worldwide used). This technology makes possible to make [[en/Manual/Trains]]s levitate (that is, to hover, or stay in the air). Because there is literally zero friction between train and its tracks, the train and its carriages move very fast. Real world speed record for a manned MagLev train is 581 km/h (361 mph) by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JR–Maglev JR-Maglev] on December 2, 2003.

In game first Maglev train (Lev1 'Leviathan' or Wizzowow Rocketeer) is available in 2022.

The toolbar for building MagLevs is found under the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] build railway menu item and are the last to be available to build. These tracks support only the MagLev specific vehicles.

None of the MagLev vehicles in OpenTTD has a real-life relative, they are a pure fantasy.
