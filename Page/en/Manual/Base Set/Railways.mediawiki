In OpenTTD '''Railways''' are the primary and most entertaining transport tool at your disposal. Versatile and efficient, railways allow [[en/Manual/Trains]] to move around with unlimited amounts of [[en/Manual/Cargo]].

In real life the first steam locomotive to operate on rails was built in 1804 (1807 - first passenger service). Diesel and electric trains and locomotives replaced steam engines in many countries in the decades after World War II.

In game first temperate climate railway train (Kirby Paul Tank) is available in 1925. The first sub-arctic and tropical landscapes train (Wills 2-8-0) is available in 1945. And the first toyland train is available in 1946.

The toolbar for building normal rails is found under the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] build railway menu item and is the first option, default when a game is started/loaded.

These default tracks support Diesel and Steam powered vehicles, but will not allow the running of Electric trains (unless [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways]] patch is disabled).
