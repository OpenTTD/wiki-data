[[Translation:en/Manual/Heightmap]]
A '''heightmap''' is a computer image that can be used to generate maps based on pixel brightness (See [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap wikipedia]).

==Using Heightmaps==
A heightmap can be considered a grayscale image where the brightest white (closest to '''#FFFFFF''') is considered as the highest point of the map, and the darkest black (closest to '''#000000''') is considered as the lowest point of the map. Look at the [[#grayscale-table|grayscale table]] below for more accurate info.

On a 1:1 image to map conversion, one pixel from the image file represents a corner of 4 tiles. Therefore, if you wish to lower/raise one whole tile, you need to make the 2x2 surrounding pixels brighter/darker.

Since edges of the map must be at sea level, at least one tile, the heightmap border can be seen as 2 pixels wide.
