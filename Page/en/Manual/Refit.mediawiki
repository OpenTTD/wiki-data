To refit your vehicle, it must first be stopped inside a depot.

#In the vehicle window, click on the '''third''' button down (a pair of boxes).
#A screen will pop-up, showing the refit options for that vehicle.
#Click on the desired new type of cargo to carry.
#In the bottom of the screen the costs and the amount of cargo is specified.
#Click on the ''refit vehicle'' button to refit.
#The cost of the refit is deducted, and your vehicle is ready to move its new cargo type.

== Refit with goto depot orders == 
You can also have a vehicle refitted with a [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Allow goto depot orders|goto depot order]], with the "Refit" instruction. This way you can have a vehicles traveling first with coal, and on his way back to the coal mine with iron ore for example. Note that you need to pay the refit costs every time the vehicle is refitted, so the refit order is only useful for vehicles traveling long distances.
