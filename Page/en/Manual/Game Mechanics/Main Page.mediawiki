Here you can find information about how OpenTTD calculates in-game figures.

You always wanted to know how the station-rating was built up? How goods-distribution works? Here you can find it!

==Player rating==

Each part of the player rating is a linear function, ie. earning 50% of the target for a component will give 50% of the points allocated for that component. Where components involve monetary amounts, these are converted to the currency of the current game; internally these amounts are stored as the pound amount.

{| border="1"

|-
|Vehicle count||>=120||0 points for 0 vehicles||100 points for at least 120 vehicles
|-
|Number of station parts player owns||>=80||0 points for 0 parts||100 points for at least 80 parts
|-
|Minimum profit of vehicles at least two years old||>=£10,000||0 points for loss or £0||100 points for at least £10,000

==Station rating==
This section shows the factors that affect how much of an industry's product is delivered to to a station.

|-
|Road vehicle crashed||Station within 22 tiles of crash ||-160|| -63%
|-
|Train crashed||Station within 30 tiles of crash ||-160|| -63%
|}
Divide the total rating points by 256 to get the percent rating.  The maximum possible rating is 99%.  Advertising campaigns give an instant, temporary boost to ratings of nearby stations.


Every 2.5 days station ratings are computed; ratings can't change by more than 2% per cycle.

==Local authority rating==
Ratings limit some player actions; they start at +500 and can change based on some actions.

Currently you can exploit the game by clearing ~200 trees and then replanting them.  This sets the rating to -1000 (the minimum), and then raises it to 220.

</td></tr></table>

Each month players' ratings automatically change:
* Rating goes up by 5 if it is less than 200.
* Rating goes up by 12 for each station that has transferred cargo in the last 50 days.
* Rating goes down by 15 for each station that has not transferred cargo in the last 50 days.


'''Example:'''<br>
A player has a rating of -300, (Very Poor), 2 active stations and 1 unactive station at a town.<br>
5pts + 2 * 12pts - 15pts = 14pts points gain per month.<br>
(-200 - -300)pts / 14pts/mo = 8 months before the town will let him build another station.

Code for town ratings is in town.h, town_cmd.c, tree_cmd.c, and road_cmd.c.

==Industry production==
Here is how the game determines how much cargo an industry produces per month.  This section lists production governed by the default [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Economy#enable-smooth-economy|smooth economy]] patch.  Production is a multiple of 8 or 9 (sometimes 10 with forests).

===Production change===
Each month the game randomly changes some industry productions.
====Smooth Economy Rules====
*The chance for a production change each month is '''4.5%'''


*If a production change does occur:
** For an industry has no service or poor (less than 60% of its cargo is transported) service: '''33%''' chance of increase, '''67%''' chance of decrease
** For an industry that has good (greater than 60%) service: '''67%''' chance of increase, '''33%''' chance of decrease
** For an industry that has excellent (greater than 80%) service: '''83%''' chance of increase, '''17%''' chance of decrease


*These two are multiplied together, (ie. 4.5% * 33% = 1.5%):
** Poor service: '''1.5%''' to increase and '''3.0%''' to decrease
** Good service: '''3.0%''' to increase and '''1.5%''' to decrease
** Excellent service: '''3.7%''' to increase and '''0.75%''' to decrease


*With the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Smooth economy]] option enabled, production changes per month are between 3 and 23%
**Industries with with very low productions, (ie. 12-40 tonnes per month) will have higher changes.
**Primary industries produce cargo 8 or 9 times a month. Monthly production is an industries 'base value' multiplied times 8 or 9.  For example, the base value for a coal mine is 15 tons, so the monthly production is 120 or 135 tons. This base value is capped at 255, so the maximum possible monthly production for any industry is 2040 or 2295.[http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=163733&sid=2128541ce7feb1a96a454f56152123a2#p163733 Ref]

====Examples====
If a coal mine has 70% of its output transported, there is a '''3%''' chance (4.5% * 67%) of a production increase from 3-23% and a '''1.5%''' chance (4.5% * 33%) of a production decrease from 3-23% (but 13% on average).

(1 + (0.03 - 0.015) * 0.13) ^12 - 1 = 0.0237 or '''2.37%'''

The coal mine will grow an average of 2.37% after the first year<br>
(1.0237 ^20) - 1 = 59.6% after twenty years<br>
(1.0237 ^50) - 1 = 321.8% or '''3.22x''' after fifty years<br>
(1.0237 ^100) - 1 = '''10.35x''' after one hundred years<br>


For an industry with rating of more than 80%, there is a '''3.75%''' chance of increase and '''0.75%''' chance of decrease:<br>
(1 + (.0375 - 0.0075) * .13) ^12 - 1 = 0.0478 or '''4.78%'''

The industry will grow approximately 4.78% after first year<br>
(1.0478 ^20) - 1 = '''2.54x''' after twenty years<br>
(1.0478 ^50) - 1 = '''10.32x''' after fifty years<br>
(1.0478 ^100) - 1 = '''106.62x''' after one hundred years<br>

For good service, it takes '''29.6 years''' on average '''to double'''; with excellent service, it takes '''14.8 years'''. If in the game's time a day is 2.36 seconds, then the '''doubling time''' with good service is '''7.1 hours'''; with excellent service, the doubling time is '''3.6 hours'''. For production to go from near bottom of 100 to near maximum of 2100 takes '''130 years''' with good service and '''65 years''' with excellent service.

However, in game you will find industries changing their production rate very randomly. It must be stressed the above examples are only true when observing many industries over the long-term; individual industries may greatly deviate from these averages. Statistically speaking, 6 out of 10 industries will not go from 100 to 2100 even with the best service during 65 years. About 1 out of 9 industries will even lower their production when being served at 60-80% cargo transported for 50 years. 

For more responsiveness from industries, adapt the number of wagons to industry production (for the lowest production, you should use two wagons). Full-load orders are usually used for such cargo trains.


'''Note:'''  The exact formula can be seen under "ChangeIndustryProduction" in industry_cmd.cpp.

==Delivery payment rates==
The amount you get paid for delivering cargo is based on 4 factors: the amount of cargo you deliver, the value of the cargo, the distance you deliver it, and how on-time you deliver it.

{| border="1" cellpadding="4"

Initial cargo payment values are for delivering 100 pieces of cargo 1 tile.  Payment goes up with inflation as the game progresses.


Late delivery penalties:
*For each day after the Early Delivery time that you deliver the cargo, you are penalized 0.4%.
*For each day after the Late Delivery time that you deliver the cargo, you are penalized an additional 0.4%.
*Maximum penalty is -88%.


'''Examples''' (no inflation):<br>
Deliver 200,000 liters of oil 20 squares in 10 days:<br>
2 * £54 * 20 squares * 100% = £2160

Deliver 100 bags of mail 100 squares in 100 days:<br>
£55 * 100 squares * (1 - 80*0.004 - 10*0.004) = £3520


'''Notes:'''
* The exact formula is much more complicated.  See economy.c and [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Cargo income]].

* Distance is measured between the stations, not from the industries or by vehicle distance traveled.  It is computed by adding the differences in x and y tiles, not straight-line distance.

==Vehicle speeds==
The game has many rules to make vehicles move fairly realistically.  A vehicle travelling at 100 mph (160kph) will cross 5.6 tiles per day.

This means that for vehicle speed purposes, a tile is 429 miles (686km) on a side!


'''Aircraft:'''
*By default aircraft fly at a quarter of their listed speed (this can be changed in patch settings).
*Aircraft accelerate at about 200 km/h/day. It varies per aircraft.
*Broken down planes fly at 345 km/h.
*Airport taxi speed is 154 km/h.


'''Road Vehicles:'''
*Road vehicles accelerate at 37 km/h/day.
*Road vehicles go around corners at half their max speed
*Road vehicles accelerate an additional 74 km/h/day downhill.
*When going uphill, road vehicles slow down 10% 4 times per tile.  This balances out with acceleration at 34 km/h for all road vehicles.


'''Ships:'''
*Ships accelerate at 37km/h/day.
*A "stopped" ship resumes it's last speed instantly.


'''Trains:''' (with the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration|realistic train acceleration patch]])<br>
*Trains are not affected going up or down hills if they are powerful enough.
*Trains are limited to entering and exiting a depot at 61km/h.
*Trains can make one 45° turn without slowing down.
*When making two or more 45° turns in the same direction, the max speed is limited as follows:
{| border="1" cellpadding="4"

*Train acceleration and max speed is affected by engine power, current speed, total train mass, and track incline.
*Non-Maglev train acceleration = 37 *(0.55 * Power / Speed - 1.3 * Mass + 60 * #cars + 0.0035 * Mass * Speed + 0.24 * Speed^2 - 60 * Mass of cars on slope) / Mass (km/h/day)
*Maglev train Acceleration = 37 * (0.022 * Power - 0.24 * Speed^2 - 60 * Mass of cars on slope) / Mass (km/h/day)
*Braking is twice acceleration except when entering a depot or a station.
*Speed limits only apply when all of the turns occur within the length of the train:
