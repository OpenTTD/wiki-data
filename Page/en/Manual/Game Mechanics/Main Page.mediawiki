Here you can find information about how OpenTTD calculates in-game figures.

You always wanted to know how the station-rating was built up? How goods-distribution works? Here you can find it!

==Player rating==

Each part of the player rating is a linear function, ie. earning 50% of the target for a component will give 50% of the points allocated for that component. Where components involve monetary amounts, these are converted to the currency of the current game; internally these amounts are stored as the pound amount.

==Station-rating==
How is the rating of goods in a station is built up?

First of all, you need to transport that certain cargo. After that, the rating is defined like in the table below (you start with 0%):

{| border="1"
|+ Station rating
|-
! Action !! Condition !! Rating-points
|-
| Max-speed of last vehicle entering station || Above 85 km/h (approx. 52 mph)|| (Speed (km/h) - 85) / 4 points (with a of max 17 %)
|-
| Age of last vehicle entering station || 3 years || 10 points (4 %)
|-
| || 2 years || 20 points (8 %)
|-
| || <= 1 years || 33 points (13 %)
|-
| Statue in town of station || Built || 26 points (10 %)
|-
| Days since last cargo pickup || > 12 days, <= 21 days || 25 points (10 %)
|-
| || > 6 days, <= 12 days || 50 points (20 %)
|-
| || > 3 days, <= 6 days || 95 points (37 %)
|-
| || <= 3 days || 130 points (51 %)
|-
| Cargo waiting at station || > 1500 units || -90 points (-35 %)
|-
| || > 1000 units, <= 1500 units || -35 points (-14 %)
|-
| || > 600 units, <= 1000 units || 0 points (0 %)
|-
| || > 300 units, <= 600 units || 10 points (4 %)
|-
| || > 100 units, <= 300 units || 30 points (12 %)
|-
| || <= 100 units || 40 points (16 %)
|}

Now divide the number by 255, and you have your new rating. Remember that is can only increase/decrease with 2% at the time.
The maximum possible rating-points is (17 + 13 + 10 + 51 + 16 = ) 107 %, but of course the maximum value is 100%.

==Local Authority Ratings==

Local authority rating ranges from -1000 (worst) to 1000 (best).
