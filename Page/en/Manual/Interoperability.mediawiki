It is possible to load TTD/TTDPatch games in OpenTTD. Look in the list below for further details.

==Transport Tycoon Deluxe savegames==
You can load any TTD savegame into OpenTTD. Possible extensions:
* *.sv1 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe saved game
* *.sv2 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe saved multiplayer game (2 players)
* *.ss1 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe preset game (included on TTDLX CD)
{{en/Note|The extension must be lower case on Unix systems!}}

==Transport Tycoon Deluxe scenarios==
Most scenarios should work. Copy them into the /scenario directory using the following extensions:
* *.sv0 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe scenario
* *.ss0 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe preset scenario (included on TTDLX CD)
{{en/Note|Again, extension must be lower case on Unix systems!}}

==TTDPatch savegames==
<warning>Not all TTDPatch savegames can be loaded into OpenTTD!</warning> In particular, if you have used '''morevehicles''', the game will not load. Certain other patches from TTDPatch are also incompatible with OpenTTD. Some patches, like [[en/Manual/Signals]] do work in OpenTTD, but others might not be loaded correctly in OpenTTD. Even if a feature is supported in both TTDPatch and OpenTTD, the savegame might not work.
