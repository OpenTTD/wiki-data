[[Translation:en/Manual/Subsidy]]
A '''Transport Subsidy''' or '''Subsidy''' is an incentive for you to transport a designated type of [[en/Manual/Cargo|cargo]] from one specific location to another. The [[en/Manual/Local authority]] will usually notify all players about the subsidy through the Newspaper. Any subsidies available, or any subsidies you or other companies in the game have been awarded (either AI or player-controlled) will appear on this screen:

Subside is awarded the first company that provide, within subside expiration date, the designated service.

The Local Authority will increase the amount of revenue made by delivering the designated cargo type between the two locations mentioned in the subsidy in the next year, which can range from twice the original revenue up to four times the original revenue. 

Players that take advantages of subsidies can find themselves making more money than players who do not. Subsidies are a good way for new players who join a [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]] game to get a strong foothold easily.

If you are carrying cargo to a city, your station (that is the station 'flag'), needs to be within 9 tiles of the city center (that is the town 'flag'). The same holds for industries, your station 'flag' needs to be within 9 tiles of the 'industry' flag.
