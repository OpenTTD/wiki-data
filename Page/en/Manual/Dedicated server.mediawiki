[[File:en/Manual/Dedicated server.png|right|frame|Dedicated server window]]A '''dedicated server''' is a OpenTTD network game [[en/Manual/Server]] that does not have a local client taking part in the game. A dedicated server can run in the background on a computer.

==Starting a dedicated server==
Run the OpenTTD executable using the {{en/C|-D|}} (capital D!) [[en/Manual/Command line]] option. 

===In Windows===
Method 1:
*Create a shortcut to {{en/C|openttd.exe|}}
*Right-click on the shortcut and click Properties
*Add {{en/C|-D|}} onto the end of the Target line
*Click Apply
*Run the shortcut


Method 2:
*On the start menu click Run
*Enter: {{en/C|"c:\(path to openttd)\openttd.exe" -D|}}
*Click OK

===In Linux===
*Run {{en/C|openttd -D|}} in a terminal. If you are connecting to the server via SSH and would like the game to run when you logout you should use [http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ GNU Screen] or [http://dtach.sourceforge.net/ dtach].

===In OS/2===
*Run the {{en/C|dedicated.cmd|}} file. If you run {{en/C|openttd -D|}}, you will not see a console window and will be unable to provide commands to the program.

==Configuring the server==
There are 3 ways to change the game options:
*Launch a single player game, change the settings, and close the game.
*Use the [[en/Manual/Console#server-commands|console commands]] to control the server while it is running.
*Edit the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] file manually. See [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Diff custom]] for some help.

Change the network settings in the Network section of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
*Set [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Lan internet]] to 0.
*Change [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server name]] so you can identify the server, 
*Set [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server advertise]] to true, so it will be visible on the [[en/Server list]]
*If you have multiple network interfaces make sure you set [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server bind ip]].
*If you are behind a router, make sure that you forward the port specified by [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server port]] (both TCP and UDP)

==Controlling the server with rcon==
Configure the dedicated server to accept [[en/Manual/Console#server-commands|rcon]] commands:
*In the dedicated server window, type {{en/C|rcon_pw <password>|}}. 
:Example: {{en/C|rcon_pw x8na7f|}}


Connect to the server as a client:
*Launch OpenTTD normally.
*Find your server on the multiplayer list and connect to it.
*Open the console (~ key).
*Type {{en/C|rcon <password> "<command>"|}}. 
:Example: {{en/C|rcon x8na7f "kick 5"|}}

==Loading a game==
In the dedicated server window (or with rcon):
*Type {{en/C|ls|}} to list the files of the current directory, a number will be beside each one, which represents {{en/C|<number>|}} below.
*Type {{en/C|cd <number>|}} to go to that directory.
*Type {{en/C|load <number>|}} to load that file.

*You can also load savegames and scenarios with the {{en/C|-g "<filename>"|}}, command line option. 
:Example: {{en/C|openttd.exe -D -g "scenario/echo.scn"|}}.
