[[Translation:en/Manual/Towns]]
The towns are where the inhabitants of OpenTTD live. 

Each town is managed by a [[en/Manual/Local authority]] that determines what actions a [[en/Manual/Transport company]] may take in each town.

The [[en/Archive/Manual/Building]]s in the towns provide a source of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]]s and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Mail]] which can be transported to other towns or even to other places within the same town.

After a period of [[en/Growth]], the towns start producing buildings that can accept [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]]. In other climates, towns can also accept [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]], [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]], [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Sweets]] and [[en/Fizzy drinks]].

If the [[en/Archive/Manual/Magic bulldozer]] option is checked, then there is the risk that the town could accidentally demolish an industry.
