[[Translation:en/Manual/Server]]
If you want to host multiplayer network games, you need to set up the OpenTTD '''server''' on your computer.

#From the Main Menu, click ''Multiplayer''
#Click ''Start Server''
#Choose a random new game (default) or one of the available scenarios
#Pick a name for your game to help others identify it, and enter it into the ''Game name'' box
#Configure the additional settings, explained below
#Click ''Start Game'' to begin - this will then allow players to join

==Settings==
*'''Set Password''' sets a password for the server so that only users who know the password can join your game.
*'''Connection''' specifies whether the server is for LAN use only, or if it advertises itself to the master server so that it shows up in the internet server list.
*'''Max clients''' limits the total number of players that can connect.
*'''Max spectators''' limits the number of clients who can connect to watch but not play.
*'''Language Spoken''' is for requesting that users speak a certain language on your server.
*'''Load game''' is used if you want to continue an existing game - apart from the fact it's an existing map, it will restart the game in the same way as ''Start Game'' and players will then be able to join.

==Ports==
If your computer is behind a firewall or [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation NAT] router, you should check that the correct [[en/Manual/Port]]s are open or forwarded.

==Dedicated server==
If you are expecting many players and aren't going to be using the machine yourself to play, you can start OpenTTD as a [[en/Manual/Dedicated server]] instead of the usual interactive graphical version.
