[[Translation:en/Manual/Server]]

If you want to host [[en/Manual/Multiplayer|multiplayer network games]], you need to set up the OpenTTD '''server''' on your computer.

'''1''' From the Main Menu, click '''Multiplayer'''

'''2''' Click '''Start Server'''

'''3''' Pick a name for your game to help others identify it, and enter it into the '''Game name''' box

'''4''' Configure the additional settings, explained below:

'''5''' Click '''New Game''' (to generate random new game), or '''Load Game''' (to continue an saved game), or '''Play Scenario''', or '''Play Heightmap''', or '''Cancel'''.

==Settings==
*'''Set Password''' sets a password for the server so that only users who know the password can join your game.
*'''Connection''' specifies whether the server is for LAN use only, or if it advertises itself to the master server so that it shows up in the internet server list.
*'''Language Spoken''' is for requesting that users speak a certain language on your server.
*'''Max clients''' limits the total number of clients (players and spectators) that can connect.
*'''Max companies''' limits the number of companies at game.
*'''Max spectators''' limits the number of clients who can connect to watch but not play (not-players).

==Ports==
If your computer is behind a firewall or [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation NAT] router, you should check that the correct [[en/Manual/Port]]s (3979 by default) are open or forwarded (both UDP and TCP for 3979).
You can change the port used by entering "server_port <port>" into the game's console.

You also need to make sure that the game can communicate with UDP on port 3978, as that is used to advertise to the masterserver. (only necessary if you want to show up on the server list)

==Dedicated server==
If you are expecting many players and aren't going to be using the machine yourself to play, you can start OpenTTD as a [[en/Manual/Dedicated server]] instead of the usual interactive graphical version.
