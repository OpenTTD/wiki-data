'''Questions regarding multiplayer aspect of OpenTTD''', e.g. joining the server, creating the server, playing the game..

__FORCETOC__
=====Does multiplayer really work?=====
:* Yes, [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]] is stable since version 0.3.5. Up until that version it was almost impossible to play multiplayer games due to the bad network design of the original TTD.

=====How many players can join an OpenTTD game?=====
:* Up to 255 players can participate in a multiplayer game. You can only open up 15 companies though. Each player can either play his own company, join another company ([[en/Community/Play Style/Cooperative gameplay]]) or watch a game ([[en/Archive/Manual/Spectator mode]]).

=====How do I start a multiplayer game?=====
:* You can either do that through the [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]] or by using the following command line syntax:
<pre>openttd -n IP[:port][#playerID]</pre>
Example:
<pre>openttd -n 192.168.0.1:3979#1</pre> would connect to 192.168.0.1 on port 3979 and joins as player 1.

=====Does it work cross-platform?=====
:* Yes. You could, for example, start a server on MacOS and players using Windows, Linux or any other system can join.

=====What port does OpenTTD use?=====
:* the default port is 3979, but you can change it to anything you like when you start a server. If you set up your own server behind a router, you need to forward both TCP and UDP on that port.
:* Communication with the master-server works via port 3979 over UDP (inbound + outbound) and 3978 over UDP (outbound)
:* If you are joining a server you do not need to forward any ports, as connections are outbound only.

=====Can I use a Dedicated Server to host a Game?=====
:* It is possible to run a Dedicated Server using the '-D' switch. See [[en/Manual/Dedicated server|"Dedicated Server"]] for more details.

=====How much bandwidth does the game use?=====
:* The rate is approximately 1.2 kbyte/sec upload and 1.2 kbyte/sec download per client.  Multiplying that up, a 10-player server will use approximately 12 kbyte/sec up and 12 kbyte/sec down (the exact numbers will depend on the number of retransmissions etc.).  Therefore, a 10-player, 24/7 server will consume 60 Gbyte/per month (30 Gbyte down AND 30 Gbyte upload) of bandwidth if all 10 players are connected the whole month.

I like trains. Burrito was here.

=====Can console commands be executed automatically?=====
:* Yes, this is possible, and can be pretty handy. The page [[en/Manual/Running Startup Scripts]] will explain this in more detail.

=====I started a new server. However, my game doesn't show up in my friends' game list, even after inserting the server manually on the list. Why does this happen?=====
:* There seems to be a problem when starting a new server from a computer connected to Internet via a modem that can be connected to multiple computers, you can fix this by forwarding port number 3979, both UDP and TCP.

=====What is a desync error?=====
:* See [[en/Manual/Multiplayer#desync-error|Desync error]].
