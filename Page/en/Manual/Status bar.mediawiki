The status bar is located at the bottom of a vehicle screen. The status can be:
* the current destination of the vehicle ([[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface#show-vehicle-speed-in-status-bar|optionally]] including the current speed);
* stopped (when the vehicle is stopped manually);
* loading / unloading (when the vehicle is in a station);
* broken down (when the vehicle is broken down and not functional for a short time)
* crashed (when the vehicle has collided with another vehicle and it's waiting to be scrapped).
