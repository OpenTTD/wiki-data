Welcome to the OpenTTD Gameplay Tutorial. Here you will be walked through starting a game, making a bus route, and then a train route.  It should take less than 15 minutes.  If you get stuck, right click on buttons in the game for help.  If you have further questions, see the table of contents for more information.  Good luck!

==Starting the game==
Open OpenTTD by double clicking the icon on your desktop. You will be presented with the main menu. 

[[File:en/GameMenu053.png]]

*Click the '''New Game''' button. This will open the World Generation screen, filled with even more dazzling options. Leave these to their defaults for now. 
*Just click the big green '''Generate''' button. The game will now create a new world for you to play in, and the game will start.

==Inside the game==
The screen you now see is what you'll be playing all of OpenTTD in. In the middle you can see the green pastures of land, perhaps with an industry, a town or a forest here and there. This is the world you'll be taming using the tools of your trade: roads, railways, harbors and airports. At the top of the screen you'll notice a menu bar. Right click some of the buttons - a popup will appear to tell you about what the button does. Some of the buttons have menus under them. You can access the menu options by holding down the left mouse button, and moving down the menu.

==Setting up a bus service==
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 1.png|thumb|300px|right]]
Let's build one of the simplest ways of transports available to you: A passenger transport service by road.. also known as a bus. 
*Press and hold the right mouse button to scroll around the map. Look for a group of houses. Each town has its name in the middle of it, followed by a number indicating its population. Try to find a town sized 500 or greater.{{en/-}}

===Building bus stations===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 2.png|frame|right]]
*Click on the Road construction button. A new window will appear with more buttons. These buttons are all related to building road-based service. 
*Click on the Build Bus Station (the little blue building). The Bus Station Orientation window will appear, giving you four choices for the orientation of your bus station. 
*Look for a free tile next to a road, surrounded by some houses. 
*Click the proper orientation button (which way does the bus station need to be turned to connect to the road?).
*Left-click on the world to place it. You'll notice a red number floating up, which indicates the amount of money you just spent.

*Repeat this procedure for another bus station in a different part of town.

===Buying a bus===
To move passengers between these two stations it would be handy to have a bus. Buses (and all other vehicles) are built in depots. 
*Build a depot by clicking the depot button in the Road construction menu, and follow the same procedure with the bus stations. Try to build it close to either of the bus stations.

[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 5.png|thumb|300px|right]]
*Click on your newly built depot. The depot menu will appear, and you get an overview of all the vehicles in there - currently none. Let's change that by building a bus! 
*Choose the ''New Vehicles'' button at the bottom of the depot. Another screen will open, this time listing all the vehicles available to you at this moment. At the top you will find the bus - an MPS Regal to be precise. 
*Select the bus and press the Build Vehicle button. A new Vehicle window will appear.

===Ordering your bus where to go===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 6.png|thumb|300px|right]]
*In the Vehicle window, click the Orders button (marked red in the picture to the right). 
*Click the ''Go To'' button, and select your first bus station. This will add an instruction to the vehicle's orders ''Go to <station name>''. 
*Click ''Go To'' again, and add your second station to the vehicles order list. Once a vehicle has reached the end of its instructions, it will start over from the beginning.
*In the vehicle window, press the bar at the bottom that says ''Stopped'', and your bus will start driving.


Congratulations! You have just built your first bus service! Over time passengers will gather at the bus stations, and your bus will collect them and drop them off at the other side of town. When this happens, you'll notice green numbers floating out of your bus - income!

Your bus may not be very profitable, as it drives only a short distance and probably will not carry very many passengers. You will need more transport services than just this little bus line in order to build your empire.

==Setting up a train route==
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial1.png|thumb|right|300px|Power station with nearby coal mine]]
The most profitable [[en/Manual/Cargo|goods type]] in OpenTTD is coal. Coal to Power Stations is the biggest money maker. 
*Scroll around the map by until you find a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Coal Mine]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Power Station]] in close proximity.

Now you have your industries, but how to get the coal to the power station?  Lets use a train, as they can hold lots of coal, and are probably the most fun vehicle.

===Building train stations===
[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|frame|right|Railroad Construction toolbar]]
*Open the Railway Toolbar by clicking on the icon that resembles railway track, next to the Road Construction button.
{{en/-}}
[[File:en/Manual/Stationgui.png|frame|right|Train station selection window]]
*Click on the button with a picture of a station building. You will be given a new station building GUI.
*Right click on the buttons to get descriptions of each button.
*Set the "Number of Tracks" set to one, and the "Platform Length" at three. Select the best orientation for your station.

[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial2.png|thumb|right|300px|Your stations next to industries]]
*Find some flat ground next to the Coal Mine and place the station. 
*Build another station next to the power plant.

===Connecting train stations===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial3.png|thumb|300px|right|Connected stations]]
Now you need to build track between the stations. 
*Connect the stations with rail by using the track buttons in the Railroad construction toolbar.  Play around laying track until you have a good track.
*Use the Dynamite button to remove misplaced track.

===Buying a train===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial4.png|thumb|right|300px|The depot window.]]
*Using the railway toolbar, select the Build Depot icon. A new window will open. 
*Place the train depot the same way as the road depot, facing a straight piece of track near the coal mine station. 
*Click on the depot and on the "New Vehicles" button, as with the bus.

*Click on a locomotive from the top of the list, then click '''Buy Vehicle'''. A train window will open. 
*Scroll down in the new vehicles window and buy '''six''' coal wagons.  Argh! I meant five! 
*Delete a wagon by dragging it to the "no-train" icon and then let go. 


Follow '''[[en/Manual/Buying trains]]''' for a more detailed tutorial.

===Ordering your train where to go===
*Assign orders to the train the same way you did with the bus, with one addition:
*In the orders list, click on the name of the coal mine station, and click the "Full Load" button. This tells the train to wait until it is full of coal.
*Click the "Stopped" button at the bottom of the train window to start the train!

Congratulations! You've built your first railway!  After the train loads and delivers the coal, you will notice that it makes much more money than the bus!

This is the simplest type of railway in the game, and can handle only 1 train.  After playing for a while you will learn how to make more complicated railways that have many trains.

==Conclusion==
{{en/Manual/Tutorial/Navigation}}
So... you have set up your first transport services. What now? Well.. It's up to you!  You can choose to build a thousand bus services all across the map, rename your company to GreyHounds-R-Us and live happily ever after. Or you could see a nice business opportunity related to a forest and a nearby sawmill. Or perhaps a subsidy is offered for shipping oil to a refinery, which makes for a profitable deal. Who knows? Just make sure you keep your company running profitably, and perhaps you'll end up as the greatest Transport Tycoon in the year 2050.

===Where to now?===
* Take any of the tutorials in the box to the left.
* Read a detailed description of the [[en/Manual/Game interface|interface]] or even more about [[en/Manual/Construction]].
* Find out what kind of [[en/Manual/Vehicles]] you will encounter in OpenTTD. Meet planes & ships.
* Follow [[en/Constructing tracks and trains|Constructing Tracks & Trains]] for more articles on laying even more tracks, making incredible junctions and some more advanced stuff.
