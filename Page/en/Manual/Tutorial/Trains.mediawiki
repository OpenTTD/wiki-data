==Setting up a train route==
Trains are faster than road vehicles and have a higher capacity, but they are more expensive and train networks require more planning than roads.

There are several types of [[en/Manual/Cargo]] and [[en/Manual/Industries]] chains in OpenTTD. The simplest and most profitable things to do is transporting [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Coal]] from [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Coal Mine]]s to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Power Station]]s, so we will set up a route for this. There's a [http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ihonkone/ottd_tut.ogg video] that demonstrates this.

===Locating your route===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial1.png|thumb|right|300px|Power station with nearby coal mine]]
Scroll around the map until you find a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Coal Mine]] and a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Power Station]] in close proximity.  For this tutorial it doesn't matter too much about how far apart they are, but the further you transport cargo the more income it generates so in a real game you won't want to pick them ''too'' close.

Now you have found some industries but we need a way to get the coal to the power station.  We'll use a train, since this is the trains part of the tutorial, and besides they can hold lots of coal and are probably the most fun vehicle.

===Building train stations===
[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|frame|right|Railway Construction toolbar]]
[[File:en/Manual/Stationgui.png|frame|right|Train station selection window]]
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial2.png|thumb|right|300px|Your stations next to industries]]
#Open the ''Railway Construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/RailCnstr.png]] button.
#Click on the ''Build railroad station'' button [[File:en/Manual/RailSt.png]]. A station building window will appear. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.
#Set the ''Number of Tracks'' to one, and the ''Platform Length'' to three. Each "unit" will take two carriages so in a real game, you choose the length of your station according to the length of the trains you want to load there, i.e. a station of 3 squares long will take one locomotive and five carriages.
#Select the best orientation for your station so that you can run the track in the right direction between the industries.
#Find some flat ground next to the Coal Mine and click to place the station. 
#Build another station next to the power plant.

===Connecting train stations===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial3.png|thumb|300px|right|Connected stations]]
Now you need to build the track between the stations. 
#Click the ''Autorail'' button [[File:en/Manual/Autorl.png]] on the ''Railway Construction'' toolbar.
#Drag in a straight line from one of the stations towards the other to lay the track.  
#Add more connecting sections until you reach the other station (you can build the track in the screenshot to the right using two drags of the autorail - one for the straight bit and another for the approach to the power station).

If you make a mistake you can use the ''dynamite'' [[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png]] tool to remove parts of the track.

===Adding a train===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial4.png|thumb|right|300px|The depot window]]
Now you need to buy some trains, but you can't just have them magically appear on your tracks - you need to build a train [[en/Manual/Depots]].

#Click the ''Build train depot'' button [[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/TrnDpt.png]] on the ''Railway Construction'' toolbar. A new window will open giving you a choice of orientations. 
#Choose an orientation and place the depot so that the front entrance is facing onto some track, like in the screenshot. Connecting rails will automatically be added so your trains can enter and leave the depot.
#Click on your newly built depot. The depot menu will appear, and you will get an overview of all the trains in there - currently none.
#Choose the New Vehicles button at the bottom of the depot window. Another screen will open, this time listing all the vehicles available to you at this moment. Click on a locomotive from the top of the list, then click ''Buy Vehicle''. A train window will open.
#Scroll down in the new vehicles window and buy six coal wagons.  
#Whoops, actually I meant to say buy five - we'll have to delete one. Drag any wagon to this: [[File:en/Manual/SellTrainVehicle.png]] button and then let go - it will be sold back and you will get some money in return.

''See [[en/Manual/Buying trains]] for a more detailed tutorial.''

===Giving orders===
#Assign orders to the train the same way you did with the bus in the earlier part of the tutorial.
#There are some extra options available for trains that we'll make use of. In the orders list, click on the name of the coal mine station in the orders list, and click the ''Full Load'' button. This tells the train to wait until it is full of coal before it leaves the station.
#Click the "Stopped" button at the bottom of the train window to start the train.

Congratulations - you've built your first railway!  After the train loads and delivers the coal, you will notice that it makes much more money than the bus.

This is the simplest type of railway in the game, and can handle only 1 train (try to add any more and you'll find they just stay in the depot).  After playing for a while and reading some of the other Railway tutorials, you will learn how to make more complicated railways that can hold multiple trains at the same time.
