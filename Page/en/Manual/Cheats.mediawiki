[[Translation:en/Manual/Cheats]]
{{en/Manual/Navigation}}{{en/Warning| By using cheats, you betray your fellow competitors. Keep in mind that such a disgrace will be remembered for eternity (This means that the use of cheats will be recorded in your saved game).}}
OpenTTD has a variety of '''Cheats''' to make gameplay easier. Cheating is not, and never will be possible in multiplayer games the way it is mentioned in this article, but see below for more information on multiplayer cheating.

*'''Ctrl + Alt + C''' -To access the cheat menu press ''Ctrl + Alt + C''. This only works in single player games. If you have another program that responds to this shortcut running, please use ''Ctrl + Alt + [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/windows_key Windows] + C''. If your keyboard does not include the Windows keys, you'll need to use the ''Ctrl + Alt + C'' combination, and in order to do that you'll need to first change that other program's settings, close it to prevent it from responding to the combination or adjust hotkeys.cfg.
*On a '''Macintosh''', press ''Control + [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command key Cmd](&#x2318;) + C'' [Or, failing that, ''Ctrl + Alt(⌥) + C''] to access the cheat menu.

Most of the cheats are self-explanatory but a brief description is available anyway.

===Increase money by £10,000,000===
Increases (or decreases) available money by £10,000,000. You can press it as many times as you like. Money cannot decrease below zero with the decrease button.

''Possible Settings:'' Any numerical value which is a multiple of £10,000,000 ($20,000,000), greater than zero.

===Playing as company #===
Allows you to play in any company (whether it be AI or a loaded multiplayer save), control their vehicles, etc.

Save your game before using this cheat because an assertion error may occur and you'll lose all you have been working on.

''Possible Settings:'' Company Number between 1-15 (Max Companies for now)

===Magic bulldozer===
The [[en/Archive/Manual/Magic bulldozer]] allows you to destroy [[en/Manual/Industries]] and other normally unmovable objects such as lighthouses. Magic bulldozer has some side effects though. As not only you as player gain higher bulldozer rights, also the towns get the ability to remove [[en/Manual/Industries]]. 

You can look here to see Magic Bulldozer in action: [[File:en/Manual/Cheat-Magic Bulldozer.png]]

[[File:en/Manual/Town After.png|thumb|center|370 px|The town after being destroyed.]]
{{en/-}}

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

===Tunnels may cross each other===
Allows you to build [[en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels|tunnels that intersect]] underground.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

ITS SO CRAP!
AND USELESS

===Jetplanes will not crash (frequently) on small airports===
Large [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] don't have a tendency to crash all the time on small [[en/Manual/Airports]]. They will crash occasionally though, with the same frequency as crashes at other airports.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
THEY NEVER DO! AND WITHOUT THIS!

===Enable modifying production values===
Allows you to modify the amount of cargo produced by industries.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span> (Although the production value max is 2,040 tonnes/2,040,000 kilograms)

===Switch climate===
You can switch a running game between the four [[en/Manual/Climates]]. This might be useful to obtain vehicles from other climates or just for fun. Note that this might have a few unwanted effects on vehicles, industries and cargo types.

[[File:en/Manual/Switch climate.png|center|frame|Switch climate cheat: a temperate landscape with a toyshop and a house from toyland, a printing works from arctic and some palm trees from tropical climate]]

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''Temperate'''</span>, <span style="color:blue">'''Sub-arctic'''</span>, <span style="color:#f4c430">'''Sub-tropical'''</span>, <span style="color:red">'''Toyland'''</span>

NOW! I BELIEVE! THIS ONE IS AWSOME!!!!!!

===Change date===
The time is at your hand! You can go back in time or travel to the future with this cheat. Click on the date to enter the desired year directly, instead of incrementing or decrementing it with the arrows.

Unfortunately, it doesn't affect inflation or expired vehicles. To regain access to expired trains, open the [[en/Manual/Console]] and type <code>resetengines</code>. Any vehicles or stations (future [[en/Manual/Airports]]) that become available while you are cheating, will still be available when you go back to the original date. Also, traveling before the year in which you began your game prevents the financial information from working properly.

==Cheats that are no longer cheats==
During the course of development of the game, new cheats have been added while others are removed. This section lists settings that were previously cheats, but can now be found elsewhere.

===Allow Electric Trains to run on normal track===
Since OpenTTD 0.7.0 this cheat has been moved to the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] menu, where it can be found under the Vehicles &raquo; Trains subcategory. This setting disables electric rails altogether.

===Build while in pause mode===
Since OpenTTD 1.1.0 this cheat has been moved to the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] menu, where it can be found under the Construction category.

==Cheating in network games==
The cheats listed on above are not available in multiplayer games.  There are two ways to enable cheats in Multiplayer:
* Modify the source code and recompile the game running on the server, something which is heavily frowned upon.
* Enable cheats in a single-player save game and then load the game at the "Start Server" menu.
If you must do this you should at least inform the clients that they are playing on a server with cheating enabled. There are, however, other ways to "cheat" in a multiplayer game.  See [[en/Community/Multiplayer cheating]] for more information on this and how to avoid it.

==Cheat Effects==
If you use or used a cheat in a specific game session, your score will not be included in the High Scores list, in that session, still cheating can be good for debugging/sandboxing purposes. (It's easy to gain money in this game, even with harder NewGRF's but sometimes you just want to test something out.)
