Ship depots are places where you can buy a ship. Ship depots are used for [[en/Manual/Servicing]] ships as well and you can sell ships you don't need any more at a ship depot.

This tutorial assumes that you already have planned a new ship route and that you already have [[en/Manual/Building docks|built the appropriate docks]].

==Finding a suitable location==
Ship depots need to be placed on water tiles and ships need to be able to access them from both sides. A ship depot is two tiles long and ships enter and exit them at the narrow ends.

Because ships need to visit the ship depot regularly for servicing, it's useful to place them somewhere along the route ships will take. Because you can't know the exact route ships take, just place the ship depot somewhere near the dock.


==Building a ship depot==

'''1.''' Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.

'''2.''' Click on the ''Build ship depot'' button [[File:en/Manual/Build dockdepot.png]]. A ''Ship Depot Orientation'' window will appear, allowing you to select the depot's direction. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.

'''3.''' Select the preferred orientation from the ''Ship Depot Orientation'' window.

'''4.''' Two white squares will indicate the future location of the ship depot. Move the mouse around to indicate the location of your choice and then just click with the left mouse button to place the ship depot.

And that's all there is to building a ship! Before we're going to buy a ship, we'll place some buoys to indicate the route our ship has to take.
