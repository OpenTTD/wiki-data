[[Translation:en/Manual/Variety distribution]]
== Explanation ==

Variety distribution is a feature of map generation which gives the option of more variability across the map. If you choose a mountainous landscape with low variety distribution then all of the map will look mountainous. If you chose high variety distribution then you will find the areas of the map which are less mountainous (ie. flat valleys etc.) and areas which are more mountainous (ie. mountain ranges). It aims to give more variety and a more "realistic" landscape.

== Development ==
Originally, Zephyris started [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=46338 a topic] in the OpenTTD Suggestions forum, and many were interested. {{en/User|peter1138}} then created a patch with some examples of maps created with the patch ([http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=841457#p841457]). It was later introduced to trunk by peter1138 in [http://hg.openttd.org/openttd/trunk.hg/rev/c3959fffa40a r18541].
