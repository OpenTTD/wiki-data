'''Drive-through road stops''' ('''DTRS''') make available a new kind of [[en/Manual/Stations|station]] for [[en/Manual/Road vehicles]].  Much like a traditional real-life "bus stop", these new stations allow road vehicles to load/unload passengers and [[en/Manual/Cargo|cargo]] simply by stopping by the side of the road, then continue along the road out the other side of the station.  These stations greatly increase the efficiency of road vehicles.

By default, a DTRS must be built either on an open plot of land, or on a stretch of road currently owned by the player.  However, you can enable the building of a drive-through on a town-owned road by setting the '''Stations/Allow drive-through road stops on town-owned roads''' patch to '''On''' within the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Stations|Configure Patches - Stations]] menu.  When a stop is built on a township road, ownership of the road itself remains with the township.  DTRS can never be built on a road owned by an opponent.


'''To build a Drive-through road stop:'''
#Open the road station menu as normal
#Click on the drive-through graphic[[File:en/Manual/DriveThru Menu.gif|none]]
#Either find an open plot of land, or find an existing stretch of road to build the station on[[File:en/Manual/DriveThru Placement.gif|none]]

==Other notes on DTRS==
[[File:en/Manual/DriveThru Multiple.gif|frame|[[en/Manual/Loading Bays#multistop|Sequenced]] Drive-throughs allow for efficient handling of multiple vehicles]]
*Vehicles can go through opponents' drive-through stops without stopping.
*Using the dynamite tool on a DTRS will remove both the station and the road, if you are allowed to remove the road. If not, the dynamite button will do nothing.  Using the remove/bulldoze tool will remove only the station and leave the road.
*If a DTRS is connected to a road on only end (rather than both), the stop will behave like a default station (i.e. the vehicle will turn around to exit the stop.)
*If not scheduled to stop at a given DTRS, road vehicles will try to avoid driving through them if an alternate route is available.
*Several stations can be built in sequence, and road vehicles arriving at the station will automatically load at the furthest open location, leaving nearer stations open to later-arriving vehicles
*DTRS are available from [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] r8735 on. They are not yet available in any release version, but are planned for inclusion in [[en/Archive/Lists/Roadmap 0.6|next version]].
