[[Translation:en/Manual/Vehicle groups]]
''Aka, '''Advanced vehicle lists'''.''
== How to get this feature ==

In Nightlies since r9874, 2007-05-19, allow using for other players since r11067, 2007-09-09. In stable since [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.6.0]].

This feature is set to "own company" by default.  The settings can be found and changed in the configure patches under the interface tab with the setting named 'Advance Vehicle list'.

== Creating groups ==
The interface for groups can be found in the [[en/Manual/Vehicle lists|vehicle list]]:
[[File:en/Manual/Groups-ungrouped.png|center|frame|The vehicle list, with groups on the left, and group management buttons labelled.]]
The buttons are fairly self-explanatory.

We have six buses running the same route (using [[en/Manual/Orders#shared-orders-2|shared orders]]), so let's make them a group for easier management.
# Click the 'create group' button.
# Click the unnamed 'Group 0' to select it. (Note that to the right of its name is a count of zero vehicles, as it is empty.)
# Click the 'rename group' button and type in a new name. In this case, we've named it after the route that they have in common.

We now need to add vehicles to our new group.
* Drag a vehicle to the group to add it.
* Drag a vehicle to the 'ungrouped vehicles' group to remove it from the group.
* Use 'remove all vehicles' from the 'manage list' menu to completely empty a group, but keep its name.
(Vehicles can only participate in a group of the same type: trains, road, air, or sea.)

We could add all of the buses this way, one-by-one, but there is a faster way.
Because they all share the same orders, once one has been added, use the 'manage list' menu to 'add shared vehicles'.
This adds the other buses with the same orders to the group.

== Using groups ==
Groups give a context to the vehicle list, like shared orders, although they can contain vehicles which are performing different routes.
(For example, we may later split these buses and make a few of them use full load orders, but still want to treat them all as one group.)
This means that we can perform the usual operations on these buses using the 'manage list' menu:
* [[en/Manual/Replace vehicles]] to upgrade them to a new model
* Send them all for a service, or to the depot to be modified manually

We can also use groups to protect vehicles from being automatically upgraded, if you've set vehicle replacement rules for 'All vehicles'.
Click the 'no autoreplace' button under the group list, which will toggle to show a small, gold sheild.
You could, for example, use this to keep a decorative steam train unchanged while automatically upgrading all other services to diesels.
