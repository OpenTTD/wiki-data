==Features==
While the game is modeled after the original by [http://www.chrissawyer.com/info.htm Chris Sawyer], OpenTTD has many additional features that enhance gameplay dramatically. OpenTTD has customizable game graphics, and work is underway to replace TTD's graphics completely. Many features were inspired by [http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch], a popular enhancement for TTD, while other features are original.
