In this tutorial, you can learn how to '''build''' (place, lay) and '''delete''' railway '''tracks''' and become proficient at building and deleting tracks.

__TOC__

==How do I lay tracks?==

First of all, you must open the Railway construction toolbar - click the railway build button ( [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] ) on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#the-menu-bar|menu bar]] to display the railway construction toolbar:

There are two ways you can lays tracks:
* Using 4 directioned track buttons (easy & quite slow)
* Using Autorail tool (fast but less easy)


== Building selected direction tracks ==

Click on one of the rail building buttons ( [[File:en/Manual/Build rail.png]] ). The example uses the 4th button.

=== Placing tracks ===

Move the cursor over the tile you want to start your track on.
[[File:en/Manual/Laying track 1.png|center|frame|Laying a new track]]

Drag the cursor to where you want your track to end.
[[File:en/Manual/Laying track 2.png|center|frame|Laying a new track]]

Release the mouse button and your new track will appear.

=== Removing tracks === 

To remove the tracks, '''select the Remove tool''' ( [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]] ). The white square will change to a red square. Now you can simply '''click & drag''' along the existing tracks to remove them. Click the tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' key shortcut.



== Using Autorail tool ==

First '''select the Autorail''' button ( [[File:en/Manual/Build autorail.png|Autorail button]] ) from the railway construction toolbar. You cursor will change to represent Autorail feature.

=== Placing tracks ===

Placing horizontal/vertical straight pieces (along squares) is the easiest. Put your cursor over any square and '''click & drag''' along the squares. The white lines represent your future tracks.
You can click in a square and move your mouse in different directions to see how new tracks would be placed.

Release your mouse cursor and you will have built a straight piece of tracks.

Placing diagonal tracks is just the same, '''click & drag''' from one square to another. Note that a diagonal track, unlike a horizontal / vertical track, occupies only half a square - meaning you can put two diagonal tracks onto one square.

Autorail tool works fine with hilly terrain, showing you how tracks will be placed on a non-uniform landscape.

=== Removing tracks ===

There are two ways to remove pieces of tracks (besides the dynamite ( [[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png|Dynamite tool]] ) tool)

The easy way to remove tracks is to hold down the CTRL key.

To '''remove a piece''' of tracks, '''hold CTRL''' and '''click & drag''' along existing piece of tracks. Just as you would when building tracks.

Release the mouse and the tracks will be sold.

The second way is to '''select the Remove tool''' ( [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]] ). The white rail-lines will change to red lines. Now you can simply '''click & drag''' along the existing tracks to remove them. Click the tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' key shortcut.  Note that where you have two diagonal pieces of track running alongside each other in the same square, you need to be accurate and only click the actual piece track you want to remove.  Just clicking anywhere in the square is not the way to do it.

== Connection types ==

There are two angles at which the tracks can connect.

===45&#176;=== 
Below is a 45&#176; connection, a train can pass through one such connection without slowing down. However, if the same train is on more than one 45&#176; connection at once, it will slow down.
[[File:en/Manual/AutorailTut9.png|frame|none|45&#176; rail connections]]

===90&#176;===
This is a 90&#176; connection. '''A train slows down considerably''' every time is has to pass one of these.

If a Vehicles patch "Forbid trains and ships to make 90&#176; turns" is enabled, then trains cannot pass this kind of connection and will stop and reverse like the end of the line.

You will find that you can become very profficient at laying tracks if you master the '''A''', Ctrl+A and '''D''' shortcut keys - A for Autorail (Ctrl for remove) and D for Dynamite. Use '''X''' to toggle tree and building transparency/visibility - also very useful.  See also the [[en/Manual/Hotkeys|list of shortcut keys]].
