[[Translation:en/Manual/Sandbox options]]
{{en/Manual/Navigation}}


OpenTTD has a variety of '''Sandbox Options''' to make gameplay easier. Using sandbox options is not possible in multiplayer games the way it is mentioned in this article, but see below for more information on that.

*'''Ctrl + Alt + C''' -To access the sandbox options menu press ''Ctrl + Alt + C''. This only works in single player games. If you have another program that responds to this shortcut running, please use ''Ctrl + Alt + <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key Windows/Super]</span> + C''. If your keyboard does not include the Windows keys, you'll need to use the ''Ctrl + Alt + C'' combination, and in order to do that you'll need to first change that other program's settings, close it to prevent it from responding to the combination or adjust hotkeys.cfg.
*On a '''Macintosh''', press ''Control + <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key Cmd]</span> (&#x2318;) + C'' [Or, failing that, ''Ctrl + Alt(⌥) + C''] to access sandbox options.

==The Main Window==

Most of the sandbox options are self-explanatory but a brief description of each option is available below. Options are listed from top to bottom.

===Increase money by £10,000,000===
Increases (or decreases) available money by £10,000,000. You can press it as many times as you like. Money cannot decrease below zero with the decrease button.

''Possible Settings:'' Any numerical value which is a multiple of £10,000,000 ($20,000,000), greater than zero.

===Playing as company #===
Allows you to play in any company (whether it be an AI company or another human company from a loaded multiplayer save), control their vehicles, etc.

Save your game before using this option because an assertion error may occur and you'll lose all you have been working on.

''Possible Settings:'' Company Number from <span style="color:green">'''1'''</span> to <span style="color:green">'''15'''</span>

===Magic bulldozer===
The [[en/Archive/Manual/Magic bulldozer]] allows you to destroy [[en/Manual/Industries]] and other normally immovable objects such as lighthouses.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

===Tunnels may cross each other===
Allows you to build [[en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels|tunnels that intersect]] underground.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

===Jetplanes will not crash (frequently) on small airports===
Large [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] don't have a tendency to crash all the time on small [[en/Manual/Airports]]. They will still crash occasionally though, with the same frequency as crashes at other airports.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

===Enable modifying production values===
Allows you to modify the amount of cargo produced by industries.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span> (Although the production value max is 2,040 tonnes/2,040,000 kilograms)

===Fix station ratings at 100%===
Allows you to fix [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics#station-rating| station ratings]] to 100%, which stops the station from losing cargo due to a poor rating.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span> (Although the production value max is 2,040 tonnes/2,040,000 kilograms)

===Edit the maximum map height===
Allows you to change the maximum map height for the current game. Note that you can't set this lower than the height of the tallest mountain on the map.

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''15'''</span> to <span style="color:green">'''255'''</span>

===Change date===
The time is at your hand! You can go back in time or travel to the future with this sandbox option. Click on the date to enter the desired year directly, instead of incrementing or decrementing it with the arrows.

Unfortunately, it doesn't affect inflation or expired vehicles. To regain access to expired trains, open the [[en/Manual/Console]] and type <code>reset_engines</code>. Any vehicles or stations (future [[en/Manual/Airports]]) that become available while you are using this option, will still be available when you go back to the original date. Also, traveling before the year in which you began your game prevents the financial information from working properly.

''Possible Settings:'' Any year from <span style="color:green">'''0'''</span> to <span style="color:green">'''5,000,000'''</span>

==Deprecated==
During the course of development of the game, new sandbox options have been added while others are removed. This section lists settings that were previously sandbox options, but can now be found elsewhere.

===Allow Electric Trains to run on normal track===
Since OpenTTD 0.7.0, this option has been moved to the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] menu, where it can be found under the Vehicles &raquo; Trains subcategory. This setting disables electric rails altogether.

===Build while in pause mode===
Since OpenTTD 1.1.0, this option has been moved to the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] menu, where it can be found under the Limitations category.

===Switch climate===
This option is not available in OpenTTD 1.2 and newer, because it is an awful hack that is likely to break the game badly and isn't even really useful.
[[File:en/Manual/Switch climate.png|center|frame|Switch climate option: a temperate landscape with a toyshop and a house from toyland, a printing works from arctic and some palm trees from tropical climate]]

''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''Temperate'''</span>, <span style="color:blue">'''Sub-arctic'''</span>, <span style="color:#f4c430">'''Sub-tropical'''</span>, <span style="color:red">'''Toyland'''</span>

==Using Sandbox Options in Network Games==
The sandbox options listed on above are not available in multiplayer games.  There are two ways to enable them in Multiplayer:
* Modify the source code and recompile the game running on the server, something which is not at all easy to do.
* Enable cheats in a single-player save game and then load the game at the "Start Server" menu.


==Sandbox Option Effects==
Using sandbox options, or as they used to be known "cheats", in the past caused the game to record the use with a tickbox to the left of the option. This is now no longer the case, although the save file itself does record whether any sandbox option has been used at any point, which can  be accessed using a savegame analyser. Currently, using sandbox options in a game will also prevent your score from showing up in the High Score list, however this is a bug which will likely be fixed at some point.
