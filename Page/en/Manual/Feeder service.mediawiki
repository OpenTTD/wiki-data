A feeder service is, put simply, one where vehicles perform a "relay" with the cargo.  For example, a bus might pass passengers onto an out-of-town airport so that they can be flown across the map to gain more revenue.

The only disadvantage to this feature is that, currently - only the final vehicle in the chain will get the revenue.

To enable feeder services, go to Configure Patches, go to Stations and make sure "Deliver cargo to a station only when there is a demand" is set to OFF.
Then use the Unload command in the first vehicles orders.

'''For example'''
Passengers arrive at the bus stop and a bus picks them up, the bus takes them to the local airport which is out of town and doesn't usually accept passengers. The bus is set to "Unload" at the airport and it does, as long as the Patch mentioned above is turned off. A plane will then arrive and pick up the passengers.
