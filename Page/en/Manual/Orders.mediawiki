[[Translation:en/Manual/Orders]]
{{en/Manual/Navigation}}
'''Orders''' are fundamental to playing OpenTTD successfully.  If you do not issue any orders, your [[en/Manual/Vehicles]] will drive around aimlessly and you will be very lucky if they make you any money.  In order to successfully pick up and deliver [[en/Manual/Cargo]] (which is after all the object of the game), you need to issue your vehicles orders.  These will be instructions such as "go here, pick up this cargo, then take it here" although there is a great deal more flexibility than that available.

==Giving Orders==
Naturally, being its owner, you are allowed to give orders to any vehicle you own.  Your drivers will try to follow these without question (although they may get lost if your network is poorly designed, but that's a separate issue). To give orders:

#First find and click on vehicle you want to give the order to.  This may be in a depot if you have just bought it or it may be an existing vehicle that's already on the move. For a train, clicking any carriage will have the same effect.  This will display the vehicle window:
#Next click on the ''Orders'' button (circled in red in the screenshot). This will display the orders window, which displays any orders the vehicle currently has (you can see our example vehicle doesn't have any).
#The fundamental type of order is [[#go-to|Go To]] - this simply instructs the vehicle to go to a station, where it will drop off any cargo it is carrying and pick up anything that's waiting (if the cargo is of the correct type for the vehicle and station).  This is the only type of order that can create a new entry in the list.  To instruct a vehicle to go to a station, click ''Go To'' and then click the target station on the map.
#Orders in the list can be selected.  Selecting an order allows you to specify various [[#order-options|options]] on it.  It also causes any ''Go To'' orders you then issue to be inserted before the selected order.

==Current destination==
You can always see the vehicle's destination in its [[en/Manual/Status bar]]. Also, in the ''Orders'' window, just before the numbers showing the indexes of the orders, you can see a black triangle pointing to one of those. That is the current destination.

==Order Options==

When you first open the ''Orders'' window, only ''Go To'' is active, or also ''Skip'' if there are already existing orders; all others are disabled. Only after clicking on one of the orders in the list do the other buttons become active. Almost all types of vehicles in the game have the same buttons at the bottom of the ''Orders'' window, except for trains, which also have a ''Non Stop'' button. To add one of the modifiers to an order (Non-Stop, Full Load, Unload), click on that order, and then on the modifier. You will see that the order will change, showing the changes you have made.

===Skip===
This will cause the train to skip the order it's currently fulfilling and move onto the next one. Pressing ''Skip'' on the last order will cause the vehicle to start again at the first one.

===Delete===
This will delete the highlighted order from the vehicle's list, effectively cancelling your service to that station with that vehicle.

===Non-stop===
This is an option for trains only, and only for an existing order.  It will prevent a train stopping at any of the stations it passes through on the way to the highlighted destination.

===Go to===
This is the way to direct a vehicle to a particular location.  It inserts a new order before the highlighted order, or if there is no order selected, adds it to the end of list.  Possible targets for go to are:
*Your own stations, but only stations where that particular vehicle is accepted. So you cannot give a bus an order to go to an airport if that airport doesn't have a bus station. You cannot send your vehicles to competitor's stations.
*[[en/Manual/Depots]] if the ''Allow goto depot orders'' is set in the ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles|Configure Patches > Vehicles]]'' window.  This will change some of the other buttons - see Service and Refit below.
*Vehicles of the same type to [[en/Manual/Orders]] or to create [[en/Manual/Orders]]. See [[#shared-orders-2|below]] for more information.
*[[en/Manual/Waypoints]], you can send a train to a particular waypoint to influence its choice of track or if the stations are too far apart and the train gets lost easily.  A [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles]] is a type of waypoint for ships travelling long distances.

===Full load===
This will ensure that the vehicle waits until it has a full load of any cargo before leaving the station.  There is a patch that orders the vehicle to wait until the train is fully loaded with ''all'' the cargos it can carry.

===Unload===
This instructs the vehicle to leave any cargo it is carrying at a station.  Any cargo accepted by that station will be handled as usual, i.e. you will be paid.  Any cargo not accepted by the station will be unloaded anyway and left for another vehicle to pick up.  That train will not receive a payment for any cargo that is not accepted.

This option also prevents the train from picking up any new cargo at that station.

===Transfer===
This option will have the train unload its cargo to a station regardless of acceptance, just as Unload does.  However in this case you will receive part payment for the distance it has travelled so far.  This is useful to run a feeder service without your vehicles showing a negative profit if they are not running the final part of the journey.  The cargo will wait in the station showing ''"En route from (source)"'' in the Waiting screen.

By default the vehicle will also collect any waiting cargo as usual.  Confusingly this can include the cargo you just dropped off!  If this is the active setting, the order will show ''Transfer and take cargo''.  If this is not what you want, you can click the ''Unload'' order as well which will toggle the order to ''Transfer and leave empty'', preventing the vehicle picking up any cargo there.

===Service===
This option is available if you have a ''go to depot'' order selected.  This will force the vehicle to be serviced in the depot.  It can be useful to include servicing in the schedule before vehicles are due to go somewhere you don't want them to break down.

===Refit===
You can include an instruction to refit a vehicle in the orders list.  When you select this you will be prompted to choose the type of cargo to refit the vehicle to carry.  This order is of limited use as normally you only refit a vehicle for a cargo once.

===Shared orders===
The [[File:en/Manual/SharedOrders.png]] icon to the right of the Transfer button is the Shared Orders button. It shows a list of all the vehicles that have the same [[#shared-orders-2|shared orders]] as the current vehicle. The icon will only be enabled if the vehicle is sharing orders.

==Timetable==
{{en/Nightly}}
Timetables are currently a [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build|nightly only]] feature within OpenTTD which creates a new level of giving orders. The timetable button is located on the right top of the orders window. All orders for the selected vehicle are displayed inside the Timetable window. You can choose how much time a train should wait in a station (in days or cycles - configure via patches) and if you wish, how much time it should take the train to travel between points of its route. There is a counter stating whether a train is on time or whether  a delay has occurred.

[[File:en/Manual/Orders-timetable.png|none|frame|That's how it looks.]]

==Copying orders==
If you want to set up a service that is used by more [[en/Manual/Vehicles]], it is repetitive to give each of these vehicles orders seperately. Imagine a bus service where 5 buses go around to 5 [[en/Manual/Stations]] in a town for a frequent passenger service. It is boring to carry out the same steps 5 times over so you can copy all orders from one vehicle to another.

===Instructions===
#Give out the orders as you would normally do for the first vehicle. 
#Now click on the next vehicle, go to its order window and press ''Go To''
#Instead of clicking a destination as before, '''click on the first vehicle''' which already has its orders set (either in its [[en/Manual/Depots]] or if it has been set loose; on the road/track/etc.)
#You will now see that the second vehicle has the same orders as the first one.

To prevent mistakes you can only copy orders to a vehicle if it doesn't already have orders. This is because in a busy station you might accidentally click on a vehicle with existing orders and overwrite all your hard work. 

Copying orders is still not the best solution because if you want to change orders later you must reassign them individually to each vehicle.  See shared orders for an even better way to give out orders.

==Shared orders==
'''Shared orders''' allow you to share one set of orders between multiple vehicles so that when one vehicle's orders are updated, the other vehicles sharing the same orders are also updated.  It doesn't matter which vehicle you update - all vehicles sharing those orders are changed.

===Instructions===
#Open the orders list for the vehicle you want to share another vehicle's orders, and click on ''Go To''.
#Hold down ''Ctrl'' and click on another vehicle that has the orders you want to share.
#Now the two vehicles share the same schedule; they are linked together.  You will see that the orders from the other vehicle are displayed and the last line now reads ''--End of Shared Orders--''.

[[File:en/Manual/Shared-orders.png|center|frame|The schedules for the 2 buses have been shared]]

You can link together as many vehicles as you want, there is no limit, but of course you can only link the same type of vehicle together because they will be using the same stations.

===Unsharing orders===
At some point you may decide you don't want a vehicle to share orders any more.  Of course you can't simply delete them because this will delete them on all vehicles linked to that share.  Instead:
#Open the orders list of the vehicle you want to remove from the share.
#Select the last line: ''--End of Shared Orders--''
#Click ''Delete''.

You will see that all orders are removed from the schedule of that vehicle, and now the last line says ''--End of Orders--'' again. All other vehicles sharing those orders are unaffected by this change. You can now control the unshared vehicle's schedule independently from other vehicles as normal.

===Notes===
*Unlike copied orders, sharing orders is possible for vehicles that already have an existing schedule. This is because to share orders you must hold down the ''Ctrl'' key, making it unlikely that you could accidentally lose the vehicle's schedule. When doing this the vehicle will lose all of its existing orders, and only have the shared ones.
*You can use the ''clone vehicle'' option to create an identical copy of a vehicle but by default orders are copied.  If you want to share orders with cloned vehicles, hold ''Ctrl'' as you click on the vehicle to clone.
*With shared orders, there is no "master" set of orders (e.g. one vehicle that stores the main orders list that the others link to) that you can inadvertantly delete.  As long as at least one vehicle with the orders you want exists, the orders list is preserved.

==Order checking ==
When you are running a large company with many different vehicles and a vast rail network, it is inevitable that mistakes will be introduced into some orders lists. For example, this can occur when a station is deleted or if you accidentally click on a hangar instead of an airport when giving orders to an aircraft.

The '''order review system''' automatically runs checks for four typical problems that can occur in an order list, and in the event it detects one, it will trigger a message that informs you about the anomaly so that you can take action.

===Not enough stations===
In order for a vehicle to make profit, it needs at least two stations in its schedule. Depots or checkpoints obviously do not count as they don't allow picking up or dropping off of cargo.

===Duplicate entries===
Sometimes it happens that a station is accidentally selected twice consecutively. For most vehicles, this causes quite a mess in the pathfinder; for example an aircraft that takes off and lands again at the same airport.

===Void orders===
[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Order-checker.png|frame|1. - Topeka station has been deleted, Bus has a ''void order''|right]]
If you delete a station a vehicle is due to stop at, the ghost of the station will be visible for a while (in the form of a grey station name label).  This allows you to construct a new station in the same location as the old one which will assume the old station's name.  Vehicles will start arriving at that station (if it's still of the correct type) without any need to change their orders.

However, if you leave it too long or deliberately don't build a new station to replace an old one, the ghost station will eventually disappear.  Any orders that vehicles had that referred to it will be replaced with '''Void Order''' and will be skipped. The (somewhat serious) exception to this is aircraft - if they were expecting to stop at an airport that isn't there any more, they will run out of fuel and crash, so be careful decommissioning airports!

===Invalid stations===
If you delete a part of a station (for example the bus stop that is attached to a train station) the order will not become void as the station does still exist. However, the vehicle has no way to get to the station as the correct facility is missing. This is lead to the vehicle searching for the station forever.
