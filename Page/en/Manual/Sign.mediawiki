Signs are simple notes you can place on any map square completely free of charge. They are coloured in your company colours.

==Placing a sign==

To place a sign, choose the landscaping toolbar and the furthest right icon on it.
Then click a square on the map on which you want to place the sign and enter the text you wish to see there. Remember that a sign can hold a very limited amount of characters, so you might want to place a few next to each other.

==Sign list==

Click and hold on a map icon. You'll see a "Sign list" there, where all signs sorted alphabetically are listed there.
