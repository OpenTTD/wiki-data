[[Translation:en/Manual/Screenshot]]


A '''screenshot''' is an image of what is seen on the screen. In OpenTTD screenshots are automatically saved to files in the game's installation directory. Screenshots are saved in one of the specified  formats ([https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable Network Graphic PNG], [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP file format BMP] or [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX PCX]) in the [[en/Manual/Game options window]]. See [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Screenshot format]] for details.

==Types of screenshots ==
''Standard'' depicts only what is actually seen on the screen (including all open menus, windows, dialogs etc.).

The ''Giant screenshot'', on the other hand, saves an image of the whole map at the closest zoom (excluding currently open windows); it does not matter where the user view camera is or what the magnification is. If the map is very large it will take a long time to save the image, and produce a large file.

==Taking a screenshot==
[[File:en/Manual/Screenshot successbox.png|frame|A message of a successful screenshot]]
There are two ways to take a screenshot:
*Opening the ''Other'' ([[File:en/Manual/Manual html 51cda05b.png|Other]]) menu and selecting ''Screenshot'' or ''Giant screenshot''.
*Pressing the ''Ctrl-S'' or ''Ctrl-G'' key combinations on the keyboard for normal and giant screenshots respectively.

A message will be shown once the screenshot has been saved showing the name assigned to the file, which is the name of your company followed by the in-game date.

==Description==
[[en/Manual/Main Page]] has a screenshot function built into it and it can save in several file formats:

:* BMP - The [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_bitmap Bitmap] format.
:* PNG - The [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/ Portable Network Graphics] format.
:* PCX - The [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX ZSoft Paintbrush] format.

To take a screenshot press ''Ctrl-S'' or hold the [[en/Manual/Game interface#other|Other button]] and select ''Screenshot''.

===Screenshots for forum posts===
The preferred format for uploading to the [http://forum.openttd.org/ OpenTTD forums] is PNG, for the following reasons.

BMPs are rather large and do not make for good formats to upload to other players.  Since PNG is not as well known as GIF or JPEG formats, the first instinct of many people is to convert the BMP to JPG or GIF.  OpenTTD is not suited to these two file formats. 

Let's look at why:
{|
|[[File:en/Manual/Screenshot optimised pngout.png|none|frame|PNG format (256 color) - 11kb]]
The 256 color PNG screenshot currently has no image loss, because OpenTTD only uses 256 colors! This is the default PNG format output.
|[[File:en/Manual/Screenshot png.png|none|frame|PNG format (16 million colors) - 30kb]]
The true-color PNG screenshot also has no image loss, but is larger because it does not index the colors.
|-
|[[File:en/Manual/Screenshot jpg.jpeg|none|frame|JPG format (16 million colors) - 33kb]]
The JPG screenshot is not nearly as sharp.  There is color loss so that makes Combo Signals and Exit Signals appear the same.
|[[File:en/Manual/Screenshot gif.gif|none|frame|GIF format (256 colors) - 40kb]]
The GIF screenshot has no image loss, but the file is larger than PNG.  GIF is always limited to 256 colors.

* A third-party tool, [http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm pngout], can further compress the png images.  


JPG is much better suited for photographs than for solid color art like OpenTTD.  

{{en/Note|PCX files are a legacy feature as the original Transport Tycoon could only save in PCX format.  PCX files do not compress very much, the example above as a PCX is 233KB.}}
