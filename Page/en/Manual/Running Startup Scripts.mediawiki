[[Translation:en/Manual/Running Startup Scripts]]
OpenTTD has the option to run one of a number of [[en/Archive/Manual/Scripts|scripts]] when it starts up.

The scripts should comprise a regular text file that's been renamed to whatever is relevent (see below). They should be put into the "scripts" directory in your OTTD install.

Local Scripts

'''autoexec.scr''' - This Script is executed on gamestart [all - use this for custom aliases per ex.]


Network Scripts

'''on_client.scr''' - This Script is executed whenever you join a server

'''on_server_connect.scr''' - This script will be executed by the server whenever a client connects (useful for motd)



These scripts should be used to set the servers port/ip and/or server optimization settings/patches.

'''pre_server.scr''' is executed before the servers tcp stack is started - ''in-game server only''.

'''pre_dedicated.scr''' is executed before the servers tcp stack is started - ''Dedicated server only''.


These network scripts should be used to set the servers name, password and so on.

'''on_server.scr''' is executed after starting a server - ''Both dedicated and in-game servers''.

'''on_dedicated.scr''' is additionally executed after starting a server - ''dedicated serveronly''.



[Note for Linux Users]
The scripts directory needs to be in the directory of the executable.

On Debian systems this is /usr/games
