[[Translation:en/Manual/Running Startup Scripts]]
OpenTTD has the option to run one of a number of scripts when it starts up.

The scripts should comprise a regular text file that's been renamed to whatever is relevent (see below). They should be put into the "scripts" directory in your OTTD install.

These scripts should be used to set the servers port/ip and/or server optimization settings/patches.

'''pre_server.scr''' is executed before the servers tcp stack is started - ''in-game server only''.

'''pre_dedicated.scr''' is executed before the servers tcp stack is started - ''Dedicated server only''.


These network scripts should be used to set the servers name, password and so on.

'''on_server.scr''' is executed after starting a server - ''Both dedicated and in-game servers''.

'''on_dedicated.scr''' is additionally executed after starting a server - ''dedicated serveronly''.
