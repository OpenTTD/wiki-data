==Buying a ship==

'''1.''' First of all, locate the ship depot you built earlier and click on it using the left mouse button. This will open the ''Ship Depot window''.

'''2.''' Next, click on the ''New Ships'' button at the bottom left of the Ship Depot window. This will open yet another window, from which you can select a ship to purchase.

'''3.''' Now you can browse through the ship catalog. Click on a ship in the upper half of the window to be able to view statistics like speed and cargo capacity. Once you've found a ship suitable to carry the cargo you want to transport, make sure it's selected and click the ''Build Ship'' button at the bottom left of the window.

'''4.''' A new ''vehicle window'' will appear. If you don't want to buy more ships now, you can close the  ''Build Ship'' and ''Ship Depot'' windows using the &times; in the upper left corner of the windows.

'''5.''' Now it's time to set up the ship's orders. How to do that is explained [[en/Manual/Orders|here]]. Make sure to add all buoys along the ship's route to it's orders as well!

'''6.''' Once you've set the orders, it's time to start the ship. This can be done by clicking on the ''status bar'' of the ship's ''vehicle window'', where it says ''Stopped''.

==Refitting a ship==
Some ships are ''refittable''. This means that you can change the type of cargo that a ship can carry. The cargo ship in the example image at the left carries [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]] by default, but this can be changed to allow the ship to carry other types of cargo.

How to refit a vehicle is covered in a [[en/Manual/Refit|separate tutorial]].

==Selling a ship==
There are a few ways to sell a ship. You can sell one ship at a time, or sell all ships in a certain depot. Either way, the ships you want to sell need to be stopped inside the depot, so you need to send the ship to the depot first.

'''1.''' Click on a ship to open it's ''vehicle window''.

'''2.''' Click the ''Send ship to depot'' button at the right side of the window.

'''3.''' Now wait until the ship has arrived at the ship depot. In the meantime, you can close the ship's vehicle window; you won't be needing that any more!

'''4.''' As soon as the ship has arrived at the ship depot, click on this depot to open the ''Ship Depot'' window. You now should be able to find the ship in the depot's window. 

'''5a.''' One way to sell the ship is to drag it to the sell-ship-icon: .

'''5b.''' Another way to sell a ship is to click on the ''Sell all ships'' button: . Please note that this will sell all ships stopped inside the depot.
