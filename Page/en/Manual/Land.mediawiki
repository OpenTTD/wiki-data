[[Translation:en/Manual/Land]]
It is possible for you to buy a piece of land.  When you do this, using the [[File:en/Manual/Buy land.png]]"buy land" tool on the landscaping toolbar, that tile of land becomes yours.  Ownership of that land will show up as a coloured sign on the tile, the colour dependent on which player owns it.

==What use is this?==
Because land that you own cannot be built on by anybody else (including town authorities), this has several uses:

*"Grabbing" prime cuts of land near towns to prevent your opponents from building there.
*Holding a piece of land until you can afford to run a route into that part and place a station.
*Buying land around stations so that you can expand at a later date, e.g. a metropolitan airport to an international.
*Blocking opponents: (this tactic is a bit dirty) When you see your opponent trying to connect a route together over a narrow strip or into a small part of town, you could buy the land to stop him building over it.  Then he'd have to route around your obstacle.
*Buying areas of land that the computer player tries to raise and lower... land that is owned by another company prohibits any raising or lowering that would destroy or move the purchased land.

==How Can I use it?==

First open the landscaping toolbar and select "buy land" -tool
[[File:en/Manual/Landscaping.png|center|frame|Fig 1. - Buy land tool selected]]
Then just click on the area you want to buy, that's it!

==How much does it cost?==

==Can I build on land that I own?==
Yes, simply build your station, tracks, road etc. over the top of the purchased tiles.

==Can I sell it back?==
Yes... you can sell a piece of land by destroying it with the bulldoze tool.

==What's to stop somebody buying up vast swathes of land and hindering the game?==
Not much, except for the monetary cost of doing this and the fact that you have to buy land one tile at a time (no drag and drop) which will take a long time.

==Can I buy someone else's land or can I force them to sell it?==
No.

==Can I buy areas of sea?==
All water is considered international waters, therefore no-one can own them.  However, you could raise land there and then buy that land to stop anyone sinking it back to water.  This would be very costly, however, and may annoy nearby town authorities.
