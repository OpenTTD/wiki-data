==Raising land==
* Select the [[File:en/Manual/Raise land.png]] tool then click on a corner of a tile.
Beware that when raising the top of a mountain, the base of the mountain will grow too.  The expense is not for the height, but for the volume of change. Avoid raising land from the sea, as it is extremely expensive and can bankrupt young companies.
You can also raise an area of land by clicking and dragging the mouse. First, the starting tile of the selection is raised by one, and then the selected area is levelled to match the starting edge, so it is basically a combination of the raise and the level tool.

==Lowering land==
* Select the [[File:en/Manual/Lower land.png]] tool then click on a corner of a tile.
Land can be lowered to sea level. Beware that areas at sea level are prone to flooding, and all tiles will be washed away.
You can also lower an area of land by clicking and dragging the mouse. First, the starting tile of the selection is lowered by one, and then the selected area is levelled to match the starting edge, so it is basically a combination of the lower and the level tool.

==Leveling land==
Use the level land tool to flatten land over a large area.

*Click and hold down the mouse where you want to start. The height of the leveled land will be the same height as the tile you started on.

*Drag the mouse over area you want to level.

*When satisfied with the area, release the button and the area will be leveled.
[[File:en/Manual/Level land after.png|none|frame|View after the area has been leveled]]

*Note: The level land tool will raise/lower as much land as possible inside your selection. Any tile whose height could not be changed with the individual raise or lower land tools will also not be changed by the level land tool. In addition, any infrastructure, buildings or obstacles in place will remain standing when the area is leveled.

==Autoslope==

This is a patch setting available in 0.6.0, under [[en/Manual/Construction]] which makes the terraforming restrictions far less severe and allows you to terraform under objects, where you normally would need to remove the object first. It automatically add/removes foundations as necessary.
