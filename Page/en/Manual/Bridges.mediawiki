When you encounter an obstacle, building a bridge might be a good solution. You can use them to build your railroad over a competitor's tracks, to make your [[en/Manual/Road vehicles]] and [[en/Manual/Trains]] cross lakes or to create crossover-free highly optimized railway [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]].

'''''See [[en/Manual/Building bridges]] tutorial to learn how to build bridges.'''''

Two types of bridges can be built:
* Road bridges
* Railway bridges

To build road bridges, open the Road Construction Toolbar ( [[File:en/Manual/Manual html ma6d6c8c.png]] ) and select the Road Bridge tool:

To build railway bridges, open the Railway Construction Toolbar ( [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] ) and select the Bridge tool:
[[File:en/Manual/BridgeTut1.png|none|frame|Selecting Railway Bridge tool]]

Bridges can be built:
* above '''flat land''' or over '''land sloped towards the bridge''' (no diagonal slopes underneath);
* '''above''' regular (full) '''water''' tiles;
* '''above regular and unmodified rail/road/canal tiles''' (same goes for constructing those under a bridge).
* '''starting and ending at different heights''' (no more than 1 level), given that the starting/ending tile is on a sloped surface while the other end is on a flat surface.
* above diagonal tracks and above tracks with signals (since 0.6.x series)

==Building bridges for beginners==
Start by opening up the build toolbar for railways and clicking on [[File:en/Manual/Build bridge.png]] (build bridges button). You'll notice that your cursor will change:
[[File:Ottdbridge1.png|none|frame|See the build bridges cursor?]]
Next you have to recognize where you can build bridges. We'll start off with a standard bridge-the-gap bridge, which can be placed in an area that looks like this:
[[File:Ottdbridge1.6.png|none|frame|What a nice place for a bridge!]]
When you move your mouse over the ground, the square the mouse is in is highlighted; the bridge will start here.

Now, just click, hold down, and drag to the opposite sloped tile, like so:
[[File:Ottdbridge3.png|none|frame|4. Remember, you're still holding the mouse button down...]]
Once you've dragged there, where you want the bridge to be, let go of the mouse button. The bridge selection dialog will open. The options will vary depending on the bridge length and the year.

Click the bridge you want, we'll select Steel Girder this time:

And... there you go, your (I suppose) very first bridge. You'll notice the red text rising, displaying the amount of money you've spent.
[[File:Ottdbridge6.png|none|frame|That cost you 579 pounds!]]
This works the same way for road construction as well; just select the bridge construction tool from the road construction tool bar.

Now we've got making bridges down, there are a few more things that you can do. Bridges can be even constructed on flat land - say to avoid a track built by competition.

Or, you can even do something like the following if the mind takes you.
