==Using the console==
Open the console with the tilde key (~), located to the left of '1' on the main keyboard. On some international keyboards the symbol may differ (e.g. on the German keyboard it is ^ TWICE).  There is also a "Toggle Console" option in the help menu. <br />
After the console is open, type in a command, such as "help" and press Enter.  

Tips:
* Scroll the console with Shift+Up/Down or Shift+Pageup/Pagedown.
* Scroll through the input history with the Up/Down arrow keys.
* Make the console bigger with Ctrl+Enter.
* Paste text from the clipboard with the normal Ctrl+V (Windows only).
