Railways and trains are probably the most fun form of transport to use in the game.  Trains are currently the most profitable vehicle.  You can build complex rail networks to handle hundreds of trains, and fully control where trains go by using [[en/Manual/Signals]] and [[en/Manual/Waypoints]].

'''''See [[en/Manual/Building tracks|Building railway tracks]] tutorial to learn how to build tracks.'''''

Click the railway build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#the-menu-bar|menu bar]] to display the railway construction toolbar.

Here is a quick list of all the buttons (from left to right) and what they do:
{{en/Manual/Railway toolbar overview}}

===Types of railways===
To select which type of railway to build, click and hold the railway build button in the main menu.
[[File:en/Manual/Openttd-rail1.png|none|frame|Choose rail type]]
* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways]] - Available in 1926. Only steam and diesel trains run on this railway.
* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways]] - Available in 1965, when electric trains arrive. Electric trains will run '''only''' on this type of track, unless you disable Electric Railways in the patch settings. Steam and diesel trains can still run on this railway.
* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Monorail]] - Available in 1999. Only trains built in a monorail depot can run on this railway.
* [[en/Manual/Base Set/MagLev]] - Available in 2022. Only Maglev trains can run on this railway.

==Building trains==
To build/purchase a new [[en/Manual/Trains]] follow these steps:
*Place/build a train [[en/Manual/Depots]] and then click it. You will be presented with the depot window. 
*Click "Build new vehicles". A new window will pop up with a list of trains to purchase. 
*Select an engine and click "Buy vehicle" at the bottom of the window. The train will then appear in one of the slots in the depot window and a train window will pop up. 
*Add wagons to your engine in the same manner. Two wagons fit in one game world tile.


'''''See [[en/Manual/Buying trains]] for a more detailed tutorial.'''''

==Tips==
* Always build stations first before tracks. When you lay a new railway, you will probably destroy some trees and anger a town's [[en/Manual/Local authority]]. The local authority will not let you build a station if you destroy too many buildings or nearby trees, but can't stop you laying track!
* When deciding to go over or under an obstruction, [[en/Manual/Tunnels|tunnels]] are preferable to [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridges]]. They are sometimes cheaper and don't have maximum speed limit.
* When deciding to go ''through'' a town however, first remove obstacles like buildings and streets that would obstruct the track. Don't get too close to its catchment area with the rest of the line and avoid destroying trees. Use bribing and reforestation to keep local authorities content with your company until all obstacles are removed.
* It is much more expensive to build track on farmland.
