== Prelude ==

So, you have this huge rail network, and monorails are introduced. You want to change your trains, so you start putting them in depots.

''30 minutes later...''

Phew... finally done.  Just have to change the trains, and I'm good to go.<br />
Grr!<br />
This should have only taken a few seconds, but I have to delete every single wagon individually!

== Surely there's a better way? ==
There is!  OpenTTD has the nifty 'delete a train' function.  Now you can simply drag the train-engine to the special train-selling icon and sell the whole thing at once!

== Alternate use ==
Another way to utilise this feature is to change the wagons on a train.  For example, if you have an oil train and want to change it to a wood train, all you need to do is drag the first wagon behind the engine, and all the wagons will be sold whilst the engine stays intact!  All you have to do is buy the new wagons and change the schedule.
