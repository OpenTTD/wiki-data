==How to make (good) profits==
:* Observe 'Cargo payment rates' (under chart icon) to see what will give you good profit
:* Search for large cities (in Town directory) and/or industries that have greatest production (in Industry directory)
:* Build long routes, try to keep them flat and without many turns (to maximize speed)
:* Use '[[en/Manual/Orders#what-do-all-those-other-buttons-do|Full load]]' in vehicle order

==How to maximize 'Local rating of transport service'==
:The higher your ratings, the more goods will be delivered to your station, so:
:* Avoid empty stations - try to keep vehicles ready to pick up goods being produced all the time
:* Build statue of company owner in nearby city (+10% of rating)
:* Keep your vehicles new (< 3 years) (?)
