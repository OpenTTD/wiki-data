:* Search for large cities (in Town directory) and/or industries that have greatest production (in Industry directory)

==Is it possible to use the operating system cursor instead of the sluggish OpenTTD cursor?==
It is possible, with a few minor changes to the code, but at the moment there is no option for it. Alternatively, you might code a [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] to do it.

==How do I relocate the menubar and status bar, since it's 'centered' on a dual-display?==

==How to get expired vehicles back?==
After 2050 vehicles expire, which means they are no longer available for you. That is really bad if you want to open a new service!

See the page [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles]] on how to avoid that.
