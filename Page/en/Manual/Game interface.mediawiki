==3D isometric gameplay world==
The OpenTTD world takes the form of a landscape, presented on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games_with_isometric_graphics isometric projection] (strictly speaking rather [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimetric_projection#Three_types_of_axonometric_projections dimetric projection]) for that 3D look.  You will spend most of your time playing here.  The world is divided up into tiles, of which there are many types.  Some are sloped, some are water, some are occupied by buildings, etc. This is where you build your transport empire!

==The status bar==
[[File:en/Manual/Status-bar.png|none|frame|The status bar]]
The status bar can be found at the bottom of page, as can be seen in picture 1., and above in picture 3. It is divided into three sections. 
*On the left you can see the date. It progresses at about 1 day every 2.5 seconds.
*The middle part, which takes up most of the space, shows various information:
**The name of your company, initially "Unnamed". After you [[en/Manual/Transport company]] it will show that name. 
**[[en/Archive/Manual/News messages]] pop up out of the status bar. Click on the status bar to display the last message.
**If you have changed the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Message settings]] to "Summary" mode, messages will scroll by here instead of popping up.
**If you have changed the message settings to "Off" mode, messages will be notified by a red dot.
**It also shows if the game is paused by saying: "* * PAUSED * *"
*The right part shows how much money you have. You can change the currency in the [[en/Manual/Game options window]] by pressing the "Options" button and then "Game options".

You may also hear "status bar" used to refer to the [[en/Manual/Status bar|vehicle status bar]].
