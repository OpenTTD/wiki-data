[[Translation:en/Wiki/Manual of Style]]
In order to try to achieve a uniform look of the manual we would like to set up a layout guide to help you towards that goal.

*[[en/Archive/Manual/Download]]s <br>
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Download|Obtaining the files]] <br>

=====External links:=====
*[http://www.openttd.org] - external link without description will be automaticly shown as [x]<br>
*[http://www.openttd.org OpenTTD] <br>
And remember: It's '''openttd.org''', not '''.com'''
===Formatting===
*'''Bold text''' <br>

==What will this layout look like?==
{{en/Warning|If you make a complex layout, ''ALWAYS'' test your wiki in multiple browsers if possible!}}
As you can probably see I am writing this Wiki in the proposed layout format. I will discuss it below in greater detail:

{|
| '''SubHeading'''||Each section should start with, again, a short question, or catchphrase of the text below and be enclosed by <pre><nowiki> ==What am I doing?== </nowiki></pre>
|-
| '''SubSubHeadings'''||Each lower heading should use a heading constant, Starting from H2 (==), go down to H6. Do not use '''bold''' for menu headings
|-
| '''Tables'''||Always use tables to show relevant data together or structure information about a given feature. Use wiki pipe style tables. That means <nowiki>{|, | and |-</nowiki>, etc. Only make really complex tables with html layout.
|-
| '''Images'''||Images should mostly be centered. If you want you can give your pictures a subscript/title. You should then put the picture in a table. If you have subscripts give them meaningful descriptions and an index telling which picture it is on the current page. The following code will achieve that: <pre><nowiki><center>[[File:Orders-3.png|center|none|frame|3. - I am a subscript!]]</center></nowiki></pre> If you have many small pictures, consider putting more of them next to eachother to have a more structured feeling. An excellent tutorial to pictures is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Picture_tutorial Picture tutorial]<br/>
If you don't have a subscript/caption ('''You should always have one!''') put your picture down like below. The important part is the last '|' after center. This will make sure that when you hover over the image, it will not say ''center'' but the picture's name.
<pre>[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longerbridges.png|center|]]</pre>
|-
| '''Patches'''||If you want to describe a patch, you should use the format as present on [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longer bridges]]. A "'''Description'''" section describing the patch, then a "'''Use'''" section telling the user how to turn on/off that feature. Lastly a preformated section telling the user what to change in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]<nowiki>  data </nowiki>
|-
| '''Wiki Links'''||Put Wiki links for keywords that you feel should be explained further. Only put the Wiki link in one place. Either the first one, or the one that you think has the biggest importance in your page. For example if I talk about Non-Stop, I'd probably will want a Wiki there. But if later on I explain in a greater detail what Non-Stop is, put the link there.
|-
| '''Request for expanding'''||If the article has been written in a bad style, it is too short, use the '''Expand''' template. To make it work correctly, you must supply a property: 
{{en/Expand|whatever}}
'''<nowiki>{{Expand|whatever}}</nowiki>'''
|-
| '''Warnings'''||Put things that you want users to note in 'warning' tags. {{en/Warning|So it will end up in a warning frame like this.}} The code for it is: '''<nowiki>{{warning|text goes here...}}</nowiki>'''
|-
| '''Notes'''||Put things that you want to others to note, but are not a warning, in 'note' tags. {{en/Note|So that it will become a note such as this one...}} The code for it is: '''<nowiki>{{note|text goes here}}</nowiki>'''
|-
| '''Lists'''
|
*Lists
**and numbered lists
#are generated
#like this:
<pre><nowiki>*list item
**list item second level
#numbered list item</nowiki></pre>
|-
| '''Various'''
|
*Put 2 newlines between the different Subheadings to see the changes more
*Put 2 newlines at the end of your wiki to have a nicer look
|-
| '''Redirects'''
|
Use redirects to point from e.g. [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] to [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] 
<pre>#REDIRECT [[waypoints]]</pre>
|-
| '''Categories'''
|
Please try to add new pages (and uncategorized ones) to the corresponding category.<br/>
You can find a list of existing categories here: [[Special:Categories]].<br/>
e.g to add a page to a category named ''Development'' add this (to the top of) the page:
<pre>[[Category:Development]]</pre>
If you are not sure what category to put a page in, just start a discussion in the Talk part of the page.
|}

==Picture==
An example of a picture with subscript (caption):
<center>[[File:en/Orders-3.png|center|frame|3. - I am a subscript (caption)!]]</center>

==An example of a patch description:==
A [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] that allows you to build more trees than originally intended.

===Description===
insert here a description of the feature. Use relatively easy to understand language, supply some examples

===Use===
Either enable this patch through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|configure patches -> construction]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:

<pre>[patches]
longtrees = true</pre>
[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longerbridges.png|center|]]
