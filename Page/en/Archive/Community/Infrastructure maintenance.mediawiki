<br />
The maintenance costs grow exponentially with the network size. This means that larger companies pay more proportionally than smaller ones.
<br />
<br />
In late game short connections between industries or cities may not earn money or even be net negative even though your finance reports are show income.
With this setting ON the player has network maintenance costs working against them, but also inflation, further driving costs higher. For more information look through ''"Economy"'' [[en/Manual/Economy]]

== Network Size Calculation ==

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Small vs spread network costs.png|thumb|middle|(fig.4) Network size example]]
[[File:en/Archive/Community/Road piece count.png|thumb|right|(fig.5) Road piece count example]]
[[File:en/Archive/Community/Tunnel piece count rails streets.png|thumb|(fig.6) Tunnel piece count]]

The costs depend on your actual tiles you use for rails and streets, and the number of intersections present on one tile. ''(fig.3)''<br />
This results in higher costs for complex networks in a small space '''vs.''' stretched out networks with more space between intersections.''(fig.4)''
<br /><br />

'''Rail Intersection Example'''<br />
One rail on one tile counts as 1 rail piece (1x1)<br />
Two intersecting rails on one tile counts as 4 rail  pieces (2x2)<br />
...<br />
Six intersecting rails on one tile counts as 36 rail pieces (6x6)
<br />
A straight rail devided by a street counts as 2 rail pieces. Like the street.
<br />
<br />
'''Rail Summary'''
The game squares the intersections on one tile and counts the result as ''rail pieces''.<br />
Street intersections are counted as 4. For each tile site with a road piece ''(fig.5)''
<br />
<br />
'''Tunnel''' ''(fig.6)''<br />
Minimum tunnel lenght      = 2<br />
Street tunnel piece count  = 8 (10 tiles = 80)<br />
Railway tunnel piece count = 4 (10 tiles = 40)<br />
<br />
''The same piece count (fig.6) goes for bridges''


== Exponential cost increase ==

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Maglev 2x10 maintenance.png|thumb|(fig.8) 20 Monorail rail costs]]


Besides the intersection multiplier the game has an algorithm which increases the costs for your network exponentially. ''(If someone can find the algorithm, please insert it here)''<br />
<br />
Here is an example list for the cost increase, with an rough factor to show the cost increase from one row to the next. (Used Maglev rails)<br />

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Rail Pieces !! Costs/yr !! Factor
|-
| 10    || 120€     || n.a.
|-
| 20    || 336€     || 2.80
|-
| 40    || 936€     || 2.78
|-
| 80    || 2,688€   || 2.97
|-
| 160   || 7,560€   || 2.81
|-
| 320   || 20,520€  || 2.71
|-
| 640   || 56,160€  || 2.74
|-
| 1280  || 159,840€ || 2.85
|-
| 2560  || 449,280€ || 2.81
|}
<br />
'''Summary cost increase'''<br />
You can say with every rail piece amount double, the costs increase around 280%<br />
(exp. 936€ for 40 pieces x 2.8 = costs for 80 pieces). ''(fig.7)(fig.8)



== Workarounds ==

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Space saving example.png|thumb|(fig.9) Space saving by stacking]]

Unfortunately to this date I know no workaround or economical solution/trick. One may think that the game can be tricked with rails over a tunnel or rails under a bridge, but no. These setups other than the saved space do not reduce the maintenance for the tile. Even though no roads or track are intercepting.
