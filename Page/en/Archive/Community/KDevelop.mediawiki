KDevelop is an IDE developed for KDE Platform. It runs natively on many Unix-like systems including MacOS.

== Importing OpenTTD to KDevelop ==
To import OpenTTD project into KDevelop follow these steps:
* prepare OpenTTD source code [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on GNU∕Linux and 🟉BSD|as usual]], configure
* in KDevelop, select ''Project -> Open / import project...''
* navigate to the root folder of source code e.g. ''~/OpenTTD'' and choose ''Makefile'' file
* enter name of the project and select "Custom Makefile Project Manager"
Now you should be able to build the project (''Project -> Build all Projects'').

== Running/debugging ==
In order to run/debug the project from KDevelop you have to create a "Launch configuration":
* from menu select ''Run -> Configure Launches...''
* on the left, select your project instead of "Global"
* click ''Add New...'' button and select ''Compiled Binary''
* next to ''Executable'' enter full path to OpenTTD binary e.g. ''~/OpenTTD/bin/openttd''
* next to ''Arguments'' enter any custom options e.g. ''-d 1''
* next to ''Working Directory'' enter full path to the run directory e.g. ''~/OpenTTD/bin''
Now you should be able to run and debug the project (''Run -> Execute launch'', ''Run -> Debug launch'').

== Useful tips ==
KDevelop comes with a background parser which gives you a real-time information on the code. It needs some tweaks however:
* Exclude "objs" directory from the project: open the ''Projects'' toolbox, locate "objs" directory in the tree, right click and select ''Exclude Item From Project''. This can be also done via project configuration window (''Project -> Open Configuration... -> Project Filter'').
* In project options (''Project -> Open Configuration...''), select ''Custom Defines And Includes -> Includes/Imports'' and add:
** path to the "stdafx.h" file e.g. ''~/OpenTTD/src/stdafx.h''
** path to the "objs/lang" directory e.g. ''~/OpenTTD/objs/lang''
** path to the "objs/setting" directory e.g. ''~/OpenTTD/objs/setting''
* In project options, select ''Custom Defines And Includes -> Defines'' and add any macros you may find useful e.g. ''ENABLE_NETWORK''. You can find OpenTTD macros in the output of ''configure'' and in the ''config.log'' file (search for ''-D'' compiler options e.g. ''-DENABLE_NETWORK'').

KDevelop also has an internal VCS GUI tool. If you have imported a Mercurial or Git "working copy" then just open the ''VCS Changes'' toolbox.

In the "Find/Replace in Files" dialog it might be necessary to add ",/objs/" to the ''Exclude'' pattern. You can also add some file extensions specific to OpenTTD e.g. ''nut'' or ''ini''.
