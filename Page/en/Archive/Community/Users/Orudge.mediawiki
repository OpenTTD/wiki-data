My name is Owen Rudge, and I'm a TTD addict. I've written or worked on many programs to do with TTD, such as [http://www.owenrudge.net/TT/ttdalter TTDAlter], [http://www.owenrudge.net/TT/ttdxedit TTDX Editor] and the [http://www.owenrudge.net/TT/ttsgm Transport Tycoon Saved Game Manager], plus a number of web sites, such as [http://www.tt-forums.net/ The Transport Tycoon Forums], [http://misc.owenrudge.net/ttgame/ The Ultimate Transport Tycoon Game Repository] (new version soon to support OpenTTD games!) and [http://www.owenrudge.net/TT/ my own TT site]. I've also done some work on OpenTTD, having contributed the Bribe Local Authority patch, the multiple screenshot format patch, and other modifications here and there.

My latest work has involved a complete port to OS/2, and also a new music playing system, which, as of 4th January, supports Ogg Vorbis, MP3, MIDI (via existing OpenTTD music drivers) WAV and also raw audio (the last one will likely be a development feature only ;)), and also supports reading custom playlists from an M3U file. Just need to fix a few bugs and I'll release it to the world! Well, to SourceForge at least...
