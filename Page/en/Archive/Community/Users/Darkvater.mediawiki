=Darkvater - OpenTTD Developer=


==Who am I?==
I am a 23 year old male from the land of legal weed. Not that I ever tried it, or will (don't do it), but it seems as if most foreigners know Holland from this notorious fact, and that Holland is inside Amsterdam. I am one of the first developers to have joined the [[en/Manual/Main Page]] project. After making one of the first patches, called ''"build on slopes"'' with a lot of help from [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Ludde]], my biggest contribution has been the addition of new airports, and coming with that a completely reworked and flexible airport movement scheme.

Since then I can regularly be found in [irc://irc.freenode.net/#openttd #openttd] fixing bugs, applying patches, adding smaller features ([[en/Manual/Signals|drag-signals]]) and generally being there. I am also the caretaker of the Windows 'port', and supply the [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] for Windows.

==His first words==
I joined the project on the 12th of March 2004, only a week after the announcement of the project on the TT-Forums. By now famous words were (trying to get build-on-slopes to work):
