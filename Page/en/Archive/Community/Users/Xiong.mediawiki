== Design Rules ==

Applies to early-20th, small FIRS/NARS maps. Probably depends also on several NewGRFs and other settings.


* Max train length: 6 tiles.
* PBS signals, spacing: 8.
** 6 tile train wants min 7 spacing + 1 for splits.
* Double track lines, 3 tile wide.
** Center line gap or bi-dir.
** Line Depots middle of bi-dir sections.
** Expand overloaded lines? 5 wide, 2x2?
** Consider separate pax/freight lines. 
* 3-track through stations; modular.
** Forced depot on entry.
** Optional exit depot. 
** Allow recirculation. 
** Larger stations assembled from modules.
** One station serves one industry/town.
* Simple junctions when possible. 
** Favor 3-way jcts. 
** Reserve additional space for expansion. 
** Depots on jct entry? 
** Signal inside jct?
