In my spare time I'm among other things drawing 32bpp graphics for the full zoom patch, have a look at [[en/Community/NewGRF/Playing with 32 bpp graphics]] to download some.

I've done so far:
- 5 temperate city buildings;

- 3 tropical city buildings;

- 8 trucks (middle era);

- 2 arctic city buildings;

- 3 industries;

- headquarters: first, second and thirth stage;
