My first patch, made when I was first exploring the OpenTTD code, allowed level crossings on diagonal track. As of yet this hasn't been committed to trunk. Since then I've worked on gradual loading, building semaphores by default before a certain date, and various other things. The largest feature was the addition of support for [[en/Archive/Manual/NewGRF Houses]], which I worked on with [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Belugas]] and [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Peter1138]].

I was first given commit access to the newhouses branch, and since became a full developer. My first commit was r6512 in the newhouses branch, and my first trunk commit was r8014.
