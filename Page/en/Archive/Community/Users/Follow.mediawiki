=== My private wish (TODO?) list ===
* proper flooding of everything (also from map sides)
* track improvements
** diagonal bridges
** signals on the bridges, on the stations
** signals on the crossings ??
** turn ramps
** mulitilevel bridges
** soft slopes (not to slow down trains)
* train loading order (fifo)
* use debt to compute company value, dividents from 25-75% owned company
* (partially?) underground station

=== My private Howto ===
