==About==
Hello, welcome on my userpage. For those who couldn't have guessed, my name is actually Yorick!
My home lives in the Netherlands, the land of legal drugs and prostitution, as many seem to know it.
I started playing openttd with the release of 0.5.1, when I found out about it on an update tracker.

If you need to know more, I'm online at IRC (#openttd) most of the day.
