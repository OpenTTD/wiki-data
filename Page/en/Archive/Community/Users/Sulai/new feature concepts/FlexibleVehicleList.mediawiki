Since Version 0.6.0 there are vehicle groups where you can put your vehicles in. This is a great improvement to the game!

Based on groups, I worked out some concepts on how to extend the capabilities of groups. Because the better the group handling, the better and more convenient you can mange a huge amount of vehicles.

So, what about computer-generated groups (lets call them '''auto-groups''') that contain vehicles that match the same properties, like
* use the same station
* have the same shared orders
* match the same vehicle property (age, profit, reliability, ...)
* are on the same network

We can divide different '''categories''', which are independent to each other and can be implemented to the game separately.

* The two new categories: '''same station''' and '''shared orders'''.
* '''tagged vehicles''' and ordinary '''groups'''
* '''property based groups''', where you can define ''vehicle property based conditions'' to form these groups.
* [[en//NetworkGroupManagement|NetworkGroupManagement]] is about groups reflecting adjacent transportation networks. It needs way more effort to be implemented, but it enables really nice features like "evaluate network" or "sell/request network".

Let's discuss these categories a little closer.

= the categories "shared orders" and "same stations" =

Imagine playing OTTD. You want to have a look at all your trains. You press "list trains" buttons from the upper menu. In older versions of OTTD a window similar to this appears:

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL without groups.png]]

Nice. But note the little difference in the upper right corner. This will expand your vehicle list to the new-styled vehicle list with groups:

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL with groups.png]]

This window works like the window we know from ottd060. But again, note the little difference in the upper left corner of the window. It's a drop down menu with currently selected "Groups". Lets click on that.

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL with groups and dropdown clicked.png]]

This dropdown element lists all available '''categories''' of groups.

You can choose between:
* '''same station''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that ''use the same station''
* '''shared orders''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that ''have the same orders''
* '''groups''', which contains the groups we know from ottd060.

These categories contain computer generated groups that contain the corresponding vehicles.

With these groups available you can do apply group commands like "go to depot" and "replace". Note: the replace feature needs some overhaul. See "details on implementation".

Now this slightly modified vehicle list window can replace the other vehicle lists of the game.

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL - same station.png]]

# open the station window
# click the little "show all trains to this station" button. At this point we get the vehicle list as expected.
# click the "extend window" button. Now we see whats really behind the window: just a group of the type "same station".

Note1: you can apply all commands under "manage list" to the vehicles shown. This is much more consistent compared to what we have now.

Note2: create/delete/rename group is grayed out as this makes no sense to vehicles groups in the "same station" category.

Note3: drag&drop should not be allowed

The same thing for the "shared orders":

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL - shared orders.png]]

# open the orders menu of a vehicle
# click the little "show all trains that share these orders" button. Again this window looks familiar.
# click on the expand button. Again you see it's just a group.

Note1:  Deleting a "shared orders" group means: every vehicle in the group gets a unshared copy of the orders.

Note2: Also creating new (empty) shared orders and giving them a appropriate name makes sense.

Note3: you can easily drag and drop the vehicles to put them into shared orders groups. (also if these are on other railway networks... =()

= the categories: "tagged groups" and just "groups" =

Lets say the category '''tagged vehicles''' lists that sort of groups we know from Version 0.6.0. The vehicles contained in those groups get little tags on the vehicle list window, reflecting the group they belong to. This automatically means, that ''one'' vehicle can only belong to ''one'' of the groups in the "tagged vehicles" section.

Let's define yet another category: lets just call them ''groups'''. Here, you can also create you own groups and place your vehicles there. But they are different from "tagged vehicles", since ''one'' vehicle can be placed in ''many'' groups. This makes sense if you want to sort your trains into groups called "long trains" and "old trains". One train could be both long and old.

If there is one vehicle in many groups, the "auto replace" feature must be adapted to the new group definition. See the end of this page.

= the category: "property based groups" =

To have the powerful group commands at hand for a variety of vehicle groups, it makes sense to have groups for many vehicle properties. '''property based groups''' allows the player to define own criterias to auto-group vehicles.

Through the vehicle list you can access the category "property based groups". Let's assume we do that in the train list window.

 '''property based train groups'''
   old trains                 (age>15)
   old trains making loss     (age>15 profit<0)
   alte Klapperkisten         (reliability<50 max_speed<100)
   long trains on net2        (train group=network002 wagons>10)
   worthless trains           (value<2000)
   old trains in Rome         (group="Rome" age>20)  -- the group "Rome" is one of the "same station" category
   red                        (profit<0)
   yellow                     (profit>0 profit<20k)
   green                      (profit>20k)

You can define your own group criteria (maybe in some input box).

= details on implementation =

== game ressources ==

Of course first priority is to keep the game as efficient as possible regarding cpu usage and network/internet bandwidth. Especially for the [[en//NetworkGroupManagement|NetworkGroupManagement]] there are deeper examinations necessary.

== (protect from global) auto replace ==

Different ways how to handle the "auto replace" feature.
#allow this button only to the category "groups"
#Slightly change the autoreplace behavior: first, there is no global auto replace. If you want to replace all trains you choose the ''group'' "all trains". Second, all vehicles in a group are "assigned" to be replaced by a certain machine when using the "replace" command. This means: giving the replace command to vehicles in a group overwrites their current replace-assignment. Because of this you can replace the same vehicle type (eg "Kirby Paul Tank") by different machines types just because they are in different groups.

== Mile stones ==

Some mile stones of implementation. Each milestone could result in a patch, which would be already an improvement to the game.

* '''Change the autoreplace behavior'''
:* treat "all trains" and "ungrouped trains" like all other groups
:* If you give the replace command to a group,
::* The "protect from autoreplace" will be deactivated from that group.
::* overwrite the vehicles current autoreplace assignment, except those being protected by some other group
* '''add "tagged groups" and "groups" categories'''
:* change the vehicle list window gui
:* the behavior of the "tagged groups" category is the same like now. (one train in one group at most)
:* the behavior of the "groups" category is like "one train can be in many groups".
:* allow "protect from autoreplace" to this new category
* '''add "shared orders" and "same station" categories'''
:* replace the corresponding vehicle list windows by a minimized version of this new window.
* '''add the "property based groups" category'''
