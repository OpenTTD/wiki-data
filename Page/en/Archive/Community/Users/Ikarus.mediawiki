=My OpenTTD Suggestions=
Here are some of my suggestions for OpenTTD, currently only for personal reference

==Gameplay==
#AI assistant
#* AI tasked with creating routes & vehicles (Human builds infrastructure)
#option to switch between ''TTD mode'' and ''OpenTTD mode''
#* these should be configuration presets
#* see below for proposed settings
#towns buy company-owned roads when inside inner city limits (area inside "tree circle")

==Construction==
#right-click de-selects current tool
#build town roads
#* cheaper than private roads (since subsidized)
#remove [[en/Manual/Building depots|Depot orientation]] window
#* orientation automatic when possible
#* orientation set by dragging to edge (depot displayed but not placed)
#advanced [[en/Manual/Landscaping#autoslope|Autoslope]], with the ability to raise/lower constructions
#* should make fine-tuning 

==Interface==
#[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings#trivia|Advanced Settings]] in tab, not tree view for Interface, Construction ... (like before)
#vehicle capacities summed
#*only different railcars displayed (with a multiplier before them) and the total capacity thereof
#a single shortcut key for removal of objects (i.e. like CTRL+placement tool, e.g. CTRL+Autorail vs. R for signals)
#alternate raise/lower ground by holding (e.g.) ALT key
#selecting "railway construction" automatically selects the [[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]] tool
#station window should display "Supplies: ..." below "Accepts: ..."
#autmatically sort vehicle lists by cargo type
#*alternatively, setting up filters (e.g. if train has passenger carriage -> assign to group "passenger train")
#manage railcars from [[en/Manual/Vehicle lists]]
#* e.g. build a Passenger Carriage and drag it to Train 12. This will instruct the train to go to a depot and have the railcar added
#* likewise moving railcars on train set

==OpenTTD Mode==
Settings I think should be enabled by default (I took the wiki pages as reference for default settings):
===[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface|Interface]]===
#Link landscape toolbar to rail/road/water/airport toolbars: On
#Position of the main toolbar: center
#*since most people have large displays (>= 1024*768)
#Automatically pause when starting a new game: On
#Default rail type (after new game/game load): Most used
===[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Vehicles]]===
#Forbid trains and ships to make 90 deg turns: On
#Disable servicing when breakdowns set to none: On
#Train accelleration model: Realistic
#Enable multiple NewGRF engine sets: On
#*especially useful for new players. This would also prevent some crashes where trains were replaced then reverted back to defaults, right?!
===[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy|Economy]]===
#Road layout for new towns: better roads
#Remove absurd road-elements during the road construction: On

==Other==
I'm not so sure how these suggestions might alter the feel of TT, so I singled them out for now
#shares bought in competing companies should add to company value (% of shares * company value)
#* likewise, you should receive money when your shares are bought
#* at the end of the year, the increase in company value should be paid to investors/owners
#* companies owning shares in each other should be no problem, since 50/50 merges can't happen
#ability to invest in vehicle research, so, e.g. Maglev would be available sooner
#ability to build platforms
#*similar to bridges, but tile by tile
#*the size of a tile
#*anything can be built on them, even diagonally (maybe even stations, i.e. multi-level stations)
#*default surface: concrete (foundation texture)
#shared road & ship depots
#* anybody can use them, but they remain owned by the builder
#* I'm curious about the Shared infrastructure patch
