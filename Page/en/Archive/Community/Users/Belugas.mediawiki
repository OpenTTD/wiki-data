== Who Am I? ==
I'm a Delphi programmer in real life.  That could explain a few things, some might say.  When i'm not behind a keyboard, or when i don't have my kid and wife around, you can find me near a water spot, mostly diving, with or without a scuba.

== What Brought me to OpenTTD? ==
I discovered OpenTTD with version 0.3.4, around september 2004.  After a while playing the game (oftenly very late at night), i told myself maybe i could help a bit. You see, when i'm not playing or diving (my other passion), i have a real life as a programmer.  So i though it would be fairly easy to make something for OpenTTD.  Yeah right...  First step would be, of course, to finally learn how to code in C.  I guess i'm still learning!

== OpenTTD work ==
That is where i started digging in the code: I wanted to get newhouses working. One thing leading to another, i've got myself into that tfc_newmap project (along with [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Glx]], [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Egladil]] and [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Rubidium]]) that lead us to gain access to trunk.  Since then, when time permits, i've touched a few areas here and there, doing map accessors, newcurrencies with newgrf, widgets not been restricted to 32, and a few projects here and there.

My very first commit for OpenTTD was the creation of the tfc_newmap branch, r3688.

Usually, you can find me on [irc://irc.oftc.net/openttd #openttd] monday to friday, 9:00h to 17:00h GMT-4:00
