It is possible to choose from a variety of currency units in the [[en/Manual/Game options window]]. All currency exhange rates are based on the value of the British Pound, as that is the currency used by OpenTTD for internal calculations. Note that some of these values have been changed in the [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] (since r23056) and are different to those in the current stable ([[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 1.1.4|1.1.4]]). As in real life, some European currencies automatically switch to the Euro after a certain date. It is also possible to create your own currency using the "custom currency" option.
