[[Translation:en/Archive/Community/FAQ troubleshooting]]
This article covers troubleshooting errors of [[en/Manual/Main Page]]. It is recommended that you try the latest [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build|nightly build]], which is the very latest version of OpenTTD, before reporting a problem publically. Often, the problem has been corrected already.

If you are experiencing errors even with the most recent build, you can run the game in debug mode. Run the game with the ''"-d1"'' flag in that case. Read more in the [[en/Development/Debugging]] section.

== The game will not start because... ==

=== ...It complains about missing files ===
OpenTTD requires the graphics sets from Transport Tycoon Deluxe in order to function. Refer to the [[en/Archive/Manual/Installation FAQ|installation FAQ]] article and ensure you have followed the appropriate steps for your Operating System.

If you have not completed these steps sucessfully, you may see one of the following errors:
* ''' 'Nix style OS ''' (Linux, OSX, Morhops, etc.): Error: Cannot open file '/usr/share/games/openttd/data/sample.cat'
* '''Windows OS''' (Win98, Win2k, WinXP, etc.): Cannot open file '<OpenTTD Install Directory>\data\sample.cat'

=== ...It crashes on Win98(SE) ===
:* Windows98/98SE has problems with DirectX and DirectMusic. Try to start the game with: <pre>openttd.exe -m win32</pre>

=== ...It outputs an error '''MD5 of <filename> is ****INCORRECT**** - File Corrupt ===
:*This error comes about if you have a corrupt or changed GRF file. OpenTTD only checks the ones for the original TTD game, either DOS or Windows version, and if it finds that the file is corrupted, it presents this message. You should copy the file from your original TTD disk again.
:*This message will also appear if you are using modified GRF files (but only if they modify the original TTD files).  Other GRF's are not checked for corruption. The message was incorporated to make sure that any problems within the game are caused by the error you report rather than corrupt files on the disk.

== When I start game in fullscreen mode, the refreshrate is changed to 60Hz! (Windows) ==
:*It's because you haven't configured DirectX properly. Try to download "DirectX Control Panel" from microsoft.com, copy it into /windows/system32, open the dialog in the Control Panel, go to DirectDraw tab, and set the "Forced Refresh Rate" to the maximum what your monitor can show.
:*You can set '''display_hz''' to have correct refreshrate. This item is in '''[win32]''' group of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]].

== When loading an older game my airports are screwed ==
:* If you have used some [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] in the early era of development of larger airports, some of the indexes could be messed up. Again, this only applies if you have used nightly builds. Official releases cannot have this problem. Copy the code below somewhere to your OpenTTD source and call the function once. Most problems should be fixed. It could be that you only have a subproblem, eg. not all are faulty, then you need to filter on ''st->index'' (easiest to get by going to station_gui.c line 396 (''"ScrollMainWindowToTile(DEREF_STATION(w->window_number)->xy);"''), setting a breakpoint there. ''"w->window_number"'' is the index of the station.

    switch (st->airport_type) { 
      case 2: st->airport_type = 3; break; 
      case 3: st->airport_type = 4; break; 
      case 4: st->airport_type = 2; break; 
    }

== Cursor is hidden in fullscreen modes under Linux ==
* OpenTTD is playable in window mode.
* Ensure you have the latest ATi propetiary drivers installed correctly, follow [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/flavio.stanchina/debian/fglrx-installer.html this guide].

This bug has been recorded and can [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=636365&aid=1332767&group_id=103924 be tracked].

== There is no sound or no music on Linux ==
This is a known issue for some systems. Only one application can send to the sound driver.
Try running the Timidity media player with commands <pre>timidity -iAD -Os</pre> or <pre>timidity -iA -Os</pre> The -iAD is daemonized, while -iA is not-daemonized

If that doesn't work. I is posible that your soundcard doesn't support multiple sound sources at once. The try ALSA compactibility mode (http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_ALSA_simple)
