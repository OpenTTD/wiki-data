'''Crossing tunnels''' is a [[en/Manual/Cheats|cheat]] which allows you to build tunnels that intersect underground. Vehicles inside the tunnels can pass through each other like ghosts instead of colliding. [[en/Manual/Main Page]] does not check for collisions underground.

== Cheat or not a cheat? ==
Developer eis_os originally implemented this feature in [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]]. He thought that long tunnels with entrances on the same elevation should be able to cross over or under each other underground. Unfortunately this feature is not limited to long tunnels; it allows unrealistic crossing of 1-tile-long tunnels. 

OpenTTD has not implemented crossing tunnels as standard, only as a cheat.

== Using the cheat ==
Press Ctrl + Alt + C and select "Enable tunnel crossings".
