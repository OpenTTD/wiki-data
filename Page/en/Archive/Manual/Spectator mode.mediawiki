[[Category:en/Manual/Multiplayer]]

Spectator mode allows you to connect to the game without starting or joining a company.  Spectators can view any information normally available in the game, and can chat with other spectators and players, but cannot interact with the game in any tangible way.  All build icons are greyed out.  Clicking on company/vehicle information icons by default shows the items belonging to the lowest numbered player's company.  Clicking and holding works as normal to select other companies' information.
