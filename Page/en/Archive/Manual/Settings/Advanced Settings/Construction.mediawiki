==Advanced Settings window: Construction section==
{{en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings}}
The Construction section allows you to set various options related to construction and terraforming. The purpose of the available settings is explained below. For each setting, the respective variable from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg|config file]] is listed with it's possible values.

__TOC__

===Signals===
====Show signals on the drive side====
Whether signals are shown on the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Show signals on the drive side|side]] what road vehicles drive on or the opposite.
<br />([construction] signal_side = <true|false>)

====Enable the signal GUI====
With this patch enabled, clicking on the [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] button will result in the opening of an extra signal toolbar, which allows you to pick certain types of signal (semaphore, light signal, [[en/Manual/Signals]]) directly without having to cycle trough them using the CTRL-key. Using CTRL to select your signal types is still possible when this patch is enabled.
<br />([gui] enable_signal_gui = <true|false>) 

====When dragging, place signals every====
When using the "Autorail" style of dragging signals (or when autocompleting signals using ctrl+drag), you can set their density (place on every Xth tile) with this setting. The number of empty track squares is equal to the set value minus one.
<br />([gui] drag_signal_density = <num_val>) 

====Automatically build semaphores before====
Makes semaphores (old style signaling) the default placed signals until the year you have configured in this patch.
<br />([gui] semaphore_build_before = <year>) 

====Signal type to build by default====
Set the type of signal to be built by default when using the signal tool. Choose between [[en/Manual/Signals#block-signals|block signals]], [[en/Manual/Signals#path-signals|path signals]] and one-way path signals. If the [[#enable-the-signal-gui|signal GUI]] is enabled, this type of signal is selected by default.
<br />([gui] default_signal_type = <0-2>)

====Cycle through signal types====
Set which type of signal should be cycled through when ctrl-clicking on a ready-built signal. Choose between cycling through all [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] types, just the [[en/Manual/Signals#block-signals|block signals]] types or only the [[en/Manual/Signals#path-signals|path signals]] types.
<br />([gui] cycle_signal_types = <0-2>)

===Allow building on slopes and coasts===
Normally you can only [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|build tracks and roads on slopes]] parallel to the incline, with this setting enabled you can build nearly everything on a slope with foundations being built automatically.
<br />([construction] build_on_slopes = <true|false>)

===Allow terraforming under buildings, tracks, etc. (autoslope)===
This patch makes the terraforming restrictions far less severe and allows you to terraform under objects, where you normally would need to remove the object first.
<br />([construction] autoslope = <true|false>)

===Allow removal of more town-owned buildings, roads, bridges, etc===
The town’s attitude is more lenient towards you [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Extra dynamite|removing]] their property.
<br />([construction] extra_dynamite = <true|false>) 

===Allow building very long bridges===
Allows you to build very [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longer bridges|long bridges]], much longer than before.
<br />([construction] longbridges = <true|false>)

===Always allow small airports===
Small airports are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Always allow small airport|not removed]] from the airport construction list when large airports appear. With this option disabled, you no longer can build small airports as soon as larger airports become available.
<br />([station] always_small_airport = <true|false>) 

===Enable terraforming the tiles at the map borders===
With this enabled, the map doesn't require to have water all around it and allows you to terraform the map's edges just as any place elsewhere. Selecting this feature also provides an extra set of buttons in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Terra Genesis Perlin|map generator]] to select the type of egde (water/freeform) for each side of the map.
<br />([construction] freeform_edges = <true|false>)
