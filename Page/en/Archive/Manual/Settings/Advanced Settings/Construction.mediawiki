====Enable the signal GUI====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
With this patch enabled, clicking on the [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] button will result in the opening of an extra signal toolbar, which allows you to pick certain types of signal (semaphore, light signal, [[en/Manual/Signals]]) directly without having to cycle trough them using the CTRL-key. Using CTRL to select your signal types is still possible when this patch is enabled.

====When dragging, place signals every====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.4)}}
When using the "Autorail" style of dragging signals (or when autocompleting signals using ctrl+drag), you can set their density (place on every Xth tile) with this setting. The number of empty track squares is equal to the set value minus one.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#00693E">'''1 tile'''</span> to <span style="color:#00693E">'''20 tiles'''</span>

====Signal type to build by default====
{{en/Feature|0.7|align="right"|text=(since 0.7.0)}}
Set the type of signal to be built by default when using the signal tool. Choose between [[en/Manual/Signals#block-signals|block signals]], [[en/Manual/Signals#path-signals|path signals]] and one-way path signals. If the [[#enable-the-signal-gui|signal GUI]] is enabled, this type of signal is selected by default.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#00693E">'''Block signals'''</span>, <span style="color:#00693E">'''Path signals'''</span> or <span style="color:#00693E">'''One-way path signals'''</span>

====Cycle through signal types====
{{en/Feature|0.7|align="right"|text=(since 0.7.0)}}
Set which type of signal should be cycled through when ctrl-clicking on a ready-built signal. Choose between cycling through all [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] types, just the [[en/Manual/Signals#block-signals|block signals]] types or only the [[en/Manual/Signals#path-signals|path signals]] types.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#00693E">'''Block signals only'''</span>, <span style="color:#00693E">'''Path signals only'''</span> or <span style="color:#00693E">'''All'''</span>
