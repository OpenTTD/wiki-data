{{en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings}}
The Construction section allows you to set various options related to trains, road vehicles, aircraft and ships. The purpose of the available settings is explained below. For each setting, the respective variable from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg|config file]] is listed with it's possible values.

__TOC__

===Routing===
====Pathfinder for trains====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for trains. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders.
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_trains = <0-2>)

====Forbid trains and ships to make 90 deg turns====
Disallows trains and ships from making sharp 90 degree turns. The NPF or YAPF pathfinder for trains needs to be enabled for this option to work for trains.
<br />([pf] forbid_90_deg = <true|false>)

====Pathfinder for road vehicles====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for road vehicles. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders.
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_roadvehs = <0-2>)

====Road vehicle queueing (with quantum effects)====
Trucks and buses [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Road vehicle queueing|queue up]] at a busy station rather than turning around.
<br />([pf] roadveh_queue = <true|false>)

====Pathfinder for ships====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for ships. The original is the default and recommended setting, but you can select newer pathfinder. YAPF for ships has the advantage of not having to use buoys for long distances, but has serious performance issues when using a large number of ships (i.e. more than ten).
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_ships = <0-2>)


===Autorenew===
====Autorenew vehicle when it gets old====
Vehicles are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|automatically replaced]] when they get old, provided that the same vehicle type is still available for purchase.
<br />([gui] autorenew = <true|false>)

====Autorenew when vehicle is ... months before/after max age====
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew months]] defines when the renew will be done. If value is set negative, vehicles will be renewed before they reach their maximum age.
<br />([gui] autorenew_months = <-12-12>)

====Autorenew minimum needed money for renew====
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew money]] defines the minimum amount of money needed before autorenew is done. If you have less cash than set here, autorenew will be suspended until you have enough money again.
<br />([gui] autorenew_money = <0-2000000>)


===Servicing===
====Service intervals are in percents====
When this switch is on the service intervals are considered to be in percents of the max. reliability rather than days. For example, if an engine has the max reliability of 80% and you set the service interval to 10% then it will go to depot at 72%.
<br />([vehicle] servint_ispercent = <true|false>)

====Default service interval for trains====
The default service interval when a new [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval trains|train]] is built.
<br />([vehicle] servint_trains = <0, 5-800)

====Default service interval for road vehicles====
The default service interval when a new [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval road vehicles|road vehicle]] is built.
<br />([vehicle] servint_roadveh = <0, 5-800)

====Default service interval for ships====
The default service interval when a new [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval ships|ship]] is built.
<br />([vehicle] servint_ships = <0, 5-800)

====Default service interval for aircraft====
The default service interval when a new [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval aircraft|aircraft]] is built.
<br />([vehicle] servint_aircraft = <0, 5-800)

====Disable servicing when breakdowns set to none====
If you have breakdowns set to none and have this switch on, your vehicles will never go to the depot for a service.
Even if this setting is enabled, vehicles will still go to depot for auto-renewal and/or replacement if those settings are activated.
<br />([order] no_servicing_if_no_breakdowns = <true|false>)

====Service helicopters at helipads automatically====
When enabled, helicopters will be serviced automatically each time they arrive at a helipad. This way, you don't need to have some airport along the helicopter's route for it to service.
<br />([order] serviceathelipad = <true|false>)


===Trains===
====Train accelleration model====
Select the default or a more [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]] calculation for trains. With this setting set to ''realistic'', trains will travel faster up hill, but slower through tight corners.
<br />([vehicle] train_acceleration_model = <0-1>)

====Enable building very long trains====
You can build extremely long trains, aka [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains]].
<br />([vehicle] mammoth_trains = <true|false>)

====Warn if train is lost====
A train will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Train is lost warning|reported lost]] if it cannot find a route to the station it is currently heading to.
<br />([gui] lost_train_warn = <true|false>)

====Enable wagon speed limits====
Some [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]'s have wagon speed limits to make them more realistic, this option will enable/disable them.
<br />([vehicle] wagon_speed_limits = <true|false>)

====Disable electric rails====
Disables electrified railways. The electric trains will run on normal tracks when this setting is active and electrified railways are not available for purchase.
<br />([vehicle] disable_elrails = <true|false>)

====Weight multiplier for freight to simulate heavy trains====
The weight of freight trains is multiplied by the multiplier set here to simulate very heavy trains for more realism.
<br />([vehicle] freight_trains = <1-255>)


===Allow goto depot orders===
All vehicles can have a [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Allow goto depot orders|depot in their schedule]].
<br />([order] gotodepot = <true|false>)

===New orders are 'non-stop' by default===
With this setting enabled, all newly assigned orders will be made '[[en/Archive/Manual/Non-stop]]' by default. With a non-stop order, vehicles will only stop at the station assigned in the order and will not halt at intermediate stations on it's route not assigned as order.
<br />([gui] new_nonstop = <true|false>)

===Review vehicle's orders===
Enable the option to [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Order review system|review the orders]] of vehicles periodically for invalid orders and other oddities.
This option may be enabled for all vehicles, disabled for stopped vehicles, or disabled altogether.
<br />([gui] order_review_system = <0-2>)

===Warn if a vehicle's income is negative===
If a vehicle's [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Train income warning|income is negative]] it will be reported in a news message. Use the [[en/Manual/Orders#transfer|transfer]] option in the vehicles order window if you want to set up a [[en/Manual/Feeder service]].
<br />([gui] vehicle_income_warn = <true|false>)

===Vehicles never expire===
Old vehicles will stay in the vehicle list for you to choose and [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles|never become obsolete]]. When enabling this setting in a running game, vehicles already disappeared from the list will not come back for purchase.
<br />([vehicle] never_expire_vehicles = <true|false>)

===Max trains per player===
Set the amount of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max trains|trains]] that a player can have.
<br />([vehicle] max_trains = <0-5000>)

===Max road vehicles per player===
Set the amount of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max road vehicles|road vehicles]] that a player can have.
<br />([vehicle] max_roadveh = <0-5000>)

===Max aircraft per player===
Set the amount of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max aircraft|aircraft]] that a player can have.
<br />([vehicle] max_aircraft = <0-5000>)

===Max ships per player===
Set the amount of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max ships|ships]] that a player can have.
<br />([vehicle] max_ships = <0-5000>)

===Plane speed factor===
Set the speed of aircraft in relation to rail, road and water vehicles. In plain TTD, the aircraft traveled at 1/4th of ground speed.
<br />([vehicle] plane_speed = <1-4>) 

===Enable timetabling for vehicles===
Allows you to use [[en/Manual/Timetable]]s for vehicles.
<br />([order] timetabling = <true|false>) 

===Enable multiple NewGRF engine sets===
When enabled, this ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Settings/Dynamic Engines]]'' feature allows multiple [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] vehicle sets to exist side-by-side. Without this feature, the maximum number of different vehicles is severely limited and vehicle sets of the same type will overwrite each others vehicles and functions. Note: using multiple vehicle sets side-by-side might result in very high or very low purchase and running costs for vehicles. Mixing wagons and trains from different train sets might result in graphical errors. 
<br />([vehicle] dynamic_engines = <true|false>)
