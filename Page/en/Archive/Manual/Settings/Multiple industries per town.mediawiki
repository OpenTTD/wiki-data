[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Multiple industries per town]]
This [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] allows you to build two or more industries of the same type on land that comes under the jurisdiction of one town.

== Description ==

Normally, if a town already has a certain type of industry, it will not allow another one of the same type to be built, i.e. there can't be two Pinningville Coal Mines.  With this patch enabled, this is allowed.
