A [[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] that sets the default interval of dragged [[en/Manual/Signals|signals]].

== Description ==
Avoiding repetitive work is something all modern software and software-designer should think about. ''Autosignals'', modelled after ''Autorail'' is one of many such features of [[en/Manual/Main Page]]. You just select a piece of rail which you want to signal, and ''Autosignal'' will do that for you. For a thorough explanation, read the [[en/Manual/Signals#i-don-t-want-to-click-a-zillion-times-to-signal-my-track|signals]] wiki page.<br />
This setting will let you change the density at which dragged signals appear. Setting this to 2 will make a signal appear every second tile, setting it to 10, every 10th, etc. ''Autosignal'' will also "autoremove" your signals at the interval selected here.

== Use ==
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Drag signal density]] is an integer setting with a default setting of 2. It can be set anywhere between 1-20. You can change this through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|configure patches -> construction]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
drag_signals_density = 3</pre>
