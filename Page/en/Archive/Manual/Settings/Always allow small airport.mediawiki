[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Always allow small airport]]
[[Category:en/Manual/Settings & Preferences]]
[[Category:en/Manual/Aircraft]]

This [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] allows you to build small airports at anytime in the game.

== Description ==
Under normal circumstances, as the game progresses, small airports become grayed out and can no longer be built. This can be a pain if you wish to build an airport but don't have the space for a city airport. If this patch is enabled, you will always be able to build small airports.

== Use ==
This feature is disabled by default. You can enable this patch through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|configure patches -> construction]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:

<pre>
[patches]
always_small_airport = true
