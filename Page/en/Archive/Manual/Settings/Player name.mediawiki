[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Player name]]

{{en/Note|Newer versions call this option <code>client_name</code>}}
This property defines the name you will have when you play [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]]. It is considered polite not to leave the name as 'Player'. It doesn't have to be anything special - possibly your nickname, forename, or initials. Use your imagination.

= Changing your name =
To change your name during a game, the <code>name</code> [[en/Manual/Console]] command can be used.
To do this, open the console and type <code>name "<newname>"</code>, replacing <newname> with your new name.

= Other differences =
The player name that you set sometimes replaces the town that you built in first (i.e. "Blah" Transport instead of Gilwood Transport)
