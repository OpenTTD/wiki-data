This [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] will enable you to set the year in which the game will start.

== Description ==

Normally the game starts in 1950 when only a handful of vehicles are available. This patch allows you to adjust the date that the game will start at, from before 1950 to 2050.  

== Use ==

Set the date at which you wish the game to start.

Be aware that setting the date too low will mean that no vehicles will be available, too high will mean that only the latest (and most expensive) technology is available.
