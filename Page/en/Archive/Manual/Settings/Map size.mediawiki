[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Map size]]
The '''Map size''' determines the size and shape of your map.  Your map must be a rectangle with sides of lengths in powers of 2, up to a limit of 2048 tiles in each direction.  OpenTTD allows you to select the Map size in the map generation window.  A large map gives you more space to spread out, but a smaller map will take less memory.  Therefore, newer and faster computers will be able to handle a larger map with more efficiency whereas a smaller map will be best suited to older computers.

=== Technical Specifications ===
'''map_x''' and '''map_y''' determine the size of the map. Each of these is calculated using the following arithmetic:

'''2 ^ map_x = number of tiles x''',<br>
'''2 ^ map_y = number of tiles y''',<br>
'''tiles x * tiles y = total mapsize'''

The ^ symbol means 'to the power of', so 2 to the power of map_x and map_y.

For example: Map_x = 10 = 1024 fields on the x-axis, map_x = 9 = 512 tiles on the x-axis.

Minimum value is 6, maximum is 11 for both. This will give you maps with a minimum side length of 64 tiles ('''map_x'''=6) up to quite large 2048 tiles ('''map_x'''=11). The same holds true for '''map_y''', so the map size ranges from 64 x 64 tiles over 64 x 2048 tiles (very elongated!) up to a square 2048 x 2048 tiles.
