===Enable Multiple NewGRF engine sets===

{{en/Feature|0.7|align="right"|text=(since 0.7.0)}}
When enabled, this feature allows multiple [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] vehicle sets to exist side-by-side. Without this feature, the maximum number of different vehicles is severely limited and vehicle sets of the same type will overwrite each others vehicles and functions. Note: using multiple vehicle sets side-by-side might result in very high or very low purchase and running costs for vehicles. Mixing wagons and trains from different train sets might result in graphical errors.
