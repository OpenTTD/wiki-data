[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Population in label]]
The population_in_label setting will either set true or false.
If set on false, the game will not show the amount of population in the towns in the town name itself (e.g. Coburg) and if set to true, you can see the population in town names ingame (e.g.: Coburg (1131))
