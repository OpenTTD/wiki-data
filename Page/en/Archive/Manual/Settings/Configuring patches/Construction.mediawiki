====Allow building on slopes and coasts====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0)}}
Normally you can only [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|build tracks and roads on slopes]] parallel to the incline, with this patch you can build nearly everything on a slope because foundations will be built under it.

==== Enable the signal GUI ====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
With this patch enabled, clicking on the [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] button will result in the opening of an extra signal toolbar, which allows you to pick certain types of signal (semaphore, light signal, [[en/Manual/Signals]]) directly without having to cycle trough them using the CTRL-key. Using CTRL to select your signal types is still possible when this patch is enabled.
