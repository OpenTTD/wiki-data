====Allow building on slopes and coasts====
(build_on_slopes) Normally you can only [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|build tracks and roads on slopes]] parallel to the incline, with this patch you can build nearly everything on a slope because foundations will be built under it.

====Allow removal of more town-owned roads, bridges, tunnels, etc====
(extra_dynamite) The town’s attitude is more lenient towards you [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Extra dynamite|removing]] their property.

====Allow building very long bridges====
(longbridges) Allows you to build [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longer bridges|very long bridges]] much longer than before.

====Show signals on drive side====
(signal_side) Whether signals are shown on the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Show signals on the drive side|side]] of the road vehicles drive on or the opposite.

====Always allow small airports====
(always_small_airport) Small airports are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Always allow small airport|not removed]] from the airport list when large airports appear.

====When dragging place signals every X tile(s)====
(drag_signal_density) When using the "Autorail" style of dragging signals, you can set their density (place on every Xth tile) with this setting. 

====Max distance from edge for Oil Refineries====
(oil_refinery_limit) This option determines the maximum allowed distance from the edge for an Oil Refinery.

====Automatically build semaphores before====
{{en/Expand|This patch isnt avalible in latest stable 0.5.3, need to find reason for it.}}
(semaphore_build_before) Makes semaphores the default placed signals until the year you have configured in this patch. 




== For 0.6.0 ==
{{en/Note|This section covers additions of patch options up to version 0.6.0 beta 3 inclusive. The above can be replaced with this as soon as 0.6.0 final is released.}}

[[File:en/Configure Patches Construction 0.6.0.beta3.png|frame|center|The Configure Patches > Construction window (0.6.0.beta3)]]

====Allow building on slopes and coasts====
(build_on_slopes = [true|false])
Normally you can only [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|build tracks and roads on slopes]] parallel to the incline, with this patch you can build nearly everything on a slope because foundations will be built under it.

==== Allow terraforming under buildings, tracks, etc. (autoslope) ====
(autoslope = [true|false])
This patch makes the terraforming restrictions far less severe and allows you to terraform under objects, where you normally would need to remove the object first.

====Allow removal of more town-owned roads, bridges, tunnels, etc====
(extra_dynamite = [true|false])
The town’s attitude is more lenient towards you [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Extra dynamite|removing]] their property.

====Allow building very long bridges====
(longbridges = [true|false])
Allows you to build [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longer bridges|very long bridges]] much longer than before.

====Show signals on drive side====
(signal_side = [true|false])
Whether signals are shown on the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Show signals on the drive side|side]] what road vehicles drive on or the opposite.

====Always allow small airports====
(always_small_airport = [true|false])
Small airports are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Always allow small airport|not removed]] from the airport list when large airports appear.

==== Enable the signal GUI ====
(enable_signal_gui = [true|false])
With this patch enabled, clicking on the [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] button will result in the opening of an extra signal toolbar, which allows you to pick certain types of signal (semaphore, light signal, [[en/Manual/Signals]]) directly without having to cycle trough them using the CTRL-key. Using CTRL to select your signal types is still possible when this patch is enabled.

====When dragging, place signals every X tile(s)====
(drag_signal_density = <num_val>)
When using the "Autorail" style of dragging signals, you can set their density (place on every Xth tile) with this setting. The number of empty track squares is equal to the set value minus one.

====Max distance from edge for Oil Refineries====
(oil_refinery_limit = <num_val>)
This option determines the maximum allowed distance from the edge for an Oil Refinery.

====Automatically build semaphores before====
(semaphore_build_before = <num_val>)
Makes semaphores the default placed signals until the year you have configured in this patch.
