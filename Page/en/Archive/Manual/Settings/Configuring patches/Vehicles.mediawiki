(realistic_acceleration) Enables a more [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]] calculation for trains.

====Forbid trains and ships to take 90 deg turns====
(forbid_90_deg) Disallows trains from making sharp 90 degree turns.

====Enable building very long trains====
(mammoth_trains) You can build extremely long trains, aka [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains]].

====Allow goto depot orders====
(gotodepot) All vehicles can have a [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Allow goto depot orders|depot in their schedule]].

====Road vehicle queueing (with quantum effects)====
(roadveh_queue) Trucks [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Road vehicle queueing|queue up]] at a busy station rather than turning around.

====New global pathfinding (NPF)====
(new_pathfinding_all) Enables the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/New global pathfinding|New global PathFinding]] algorithm.

====Warn if a train's income is negative====
(train_income_warn) If a train's [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Train income warning|income is negative]] it will be reported in a news message. At the moment there is no option for all vehicles to get revenue in a [[en/Manual/Feeder service]] so you may want to turn this off.

====Review vehicles' orders====
(order_review_system) Enable the option to [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Order review system|review the orders]] of vehicles periodically for invalid orders and other oddities.

This option may be enabled for all vehicles, disabled for stopped vehicles, or disabled altogether.

====Vehicles never expire====
(never_expire_vehicles) Old vehicles will stay in the vehicle list for you to choose and [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles|never become obsolete]].

====A train is lost if no progress is made for (x days)====
(lost_train_days) A train will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Train is lost warning|reported lost]] if the station it is currently heading to has not been reached in this amount of time.

====Auto renew vehicle when it gets old====
(autorenew) Vehicles are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|automatically replaced]] when they get old.

(autorenew_months) [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew months]] defines when the renew will be done.

(autorenew_money) [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew money]] defines the minimum amount of money needed before autorenew is done.

====Max trains / road vehicles / aircraft / ships per player====
(max_trains/max_roadveh/max_aircraft/max_ships) Set the amount of vehicles that a player can have ([[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max trains|trains]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max road vehicles|road vehicles]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max aircraft|aircraft]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max ships|ships]]).

====Service intervals are in percents====
(servint_ispercent) When this switch is on the service intervals are considered to be in percents of the max. reliability rather than days. For example, if an engine has the max reliability of 80% and you set the service interval to 10% then it will go to depot at 72%.

{{en/Note|You can hold the Ctrl key while changing service intervals to change them in increments of 5 rather than 10.}}

====Default service interval for trains / road vehicles / aircraft / ships====
(servint_trains/servint_roadveh/servint_aircraft/servint_ships). 
The default service interval for each vehicle type when a new one is built ([[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval trains|trains]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval road vehicles|road vehicles]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval aircraft|aircraft]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval ships|ships]]).

====Disable servicing when breakdowns set to none====
(no_servicing_if_no_breakdowns) If you have breakdowns set to none and have this switch is on, your vehicles will never go to the depot for a service.
{{en/Note|Currently if you have "Auto renew vehicle when it gets old" or "Autoreplace" on, your vehicles will still not go to a depot for replacement.}}

====Enable wagon speed limits====
(wagon_speed_limits) Some newgrf's have wagon speed limits to make them more realistic, this option will enable/disable them.
