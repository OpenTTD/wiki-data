[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Inflation]]
Inflation, as in the "real" world, causes prices to go up as time passes. There is a patch for turning this feature off.

*In versions prior to 0.7.0, the patch is controlled from [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Economy|Configure Patches > Economy]].
*Versions 0.7.0 and later have this feature under [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy|Advanced Settings > Economy]].
*You can also edit the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] file and use the following syntax to disable inflation:
<pre>[patches]
inflation = false</pre>
