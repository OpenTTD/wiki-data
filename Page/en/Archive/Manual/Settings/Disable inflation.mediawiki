[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Disable inflation]]


A [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] that completely disables [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Inflation]], meaning all prices will stay constant throughout the game.


== Description ==
All prices stay constant throughout the whole game with this patch. This way you can easily see how much more profit you are making compared to the recent years.


== Use ==
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Inflation]] is enabled by default. You can disable it through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Economy|configure patches -> economy]] window (versions prior to 0.7.0) or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
