[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Freeform edges]]
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Freeform edges]] is an [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] available since [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.7.0]] or r15190. If enabled, the classic limitation that the map edges have to be water is lifted. This also means you can now terraform at the map borders to your liking.
To cope with this new feature, you can now select the border type (Water, or Freeform) for each border individually when generating a new map using [[en/Archive/Manual/Terra Genesis Perlin]]. Or select ''random'' to let the game choose for you.
