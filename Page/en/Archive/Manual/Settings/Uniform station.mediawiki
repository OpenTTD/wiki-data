A [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Uniform station]] consists of any number of [[en/Physical station]]s combined into a single [[en/Logical station]], such that all underlying rail is parallel and the [[en/Combined station]] exactly fills a rectangle. A single, one-tile physical station may be considered a degenerate case. One would probably only insist on speaking of a uniform station as large as, or larger than, two tracks and two platforms per track. 

Most users will just say "station" for any size uniform station. Any station created with a single click will be uniform. Original game mechanics demanded that all stations be uniform but patches and settings now allow other forms.
