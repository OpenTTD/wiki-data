[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Screenshot format]]
[[Category:en/Manual/Settings & Preferences]]

The screenshot format to use when taking screenshots. This is a client-setting only.

==Description==
[[en/Manual/Main Page]] has a screenshot function built into it and it can save in several file formats:

:* BMP - The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_bitmap Bitmap] format.
:* PNG - The [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/ Portable Network Graphics] format.  Note: This is only available if OpenTTD has been compiled with zlib and libpng support.
:* PCX - The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX ZSoft Paintbrush] format.

To take a screenshot press ''Ctrl-S'' or hold the [http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/Game_interface#Various Other button] and select ''Screenshot''.

===Making screenshots for uploading===
The preferred format for uploading to the [http://www.tt-forums.net/index.php?c=20 OpenTTD forums] is PNG.  The following is the reasoning behind this.

BMPs are rather large and do not make for good formats to upload to other players.  Since PNG is not as well known as GIF or JPEG formats, the first instinct of many people is to convert the BMP to JPG or GIF.  OpenTTD is not suited to these two file formats.  Let's look at why:

*The PNG screenshot has no image loss at all.  The file size is 30KB.
*The JPG screenshot is not nearly as sharp.  The file size is 33KB.  More importantly, there is a lot of color loss so that you cannot tell the difference between Combo Signals and Exit Signals.
*The GIF screenshot has no image loss at all,  but the file size is 40KB.
*The optimized PNG screenshot has no image loss at all. The file size is 11KB. (Requires third-party tool, ''[http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm pngout]''.)
*An equivalent colour indexed PNG with no image loss is 11KB.  This is becuase OpenTTD at the moment has up to 256 colours only.

JPG is much better suited for photographs than for solid color art like OpenTTD.  Please use PNG format for all posts to the forum.

{{en/Note|PCX files are a legacy feature as the original Transport Tycoon could only save in PCX format.  PCX files do not compress very much, the example above as a PCX is 233KB.}}

==Use==

"BMP" is the default setting.  You may change this setting through the [[en/Manual/Game options window]] or [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] with the following syntax:

<pre>
[misc]
screenshot_format = <Valid options>
</pre>

'''Valid options:''' [ <empty> | bmp | png | pcx ]

'''Default:''' <empty>

If an invalid setting is entered, then it will revert to the default.
