== Description ==
Yet Another Pathfinder (YAPF) is the third attempt at creating a pathfinder algorithm for OpenTTD.  The first new algorithm is [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/New train pathfinding|New Train Pathfinding (NTP)]], which only worked on trains. The second is [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/New global pathfinding|New global Pathfinding (NPF)]], which works on all vehicles and is quite intelligent, but has the problem of being processor intensive, bogging down the system after so many vehicles have been built.

The goal of YAPF is to provide the power and flexibility of NPF while at the same time being very optimized, relieving the CPU load.  

== Beta Test ==
To help out in the beta testing and to get a sneak preview, download the executable from the [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]].

The code can be downloaded with [[en/Development/FAQ development#source-code|Subversion]] from the trunk:

svn://svn.openttd.com/trunk

== Dependant Projects ==
You can't change one part of the code without some effect on the other parts, and pathfinding is a huge part.

==== Path Based Signalling ====
One of the main projects that has been put on hold until YAPF is finished is [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another PBS Patch|Path Based Signalling (PBS)]]. The PBS code was interwoven in with the NPF code, and was considered too buggy and the code too messy to stay in the main branch. Once YAPF is complete, work should begin on a completely new PBS algorithm.

==== Speed Signs ====
A modest project to control which trains go on which tracks based on their speed, [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=24187 Speed Signs] will also be affected by YAPF once it is implemented.
