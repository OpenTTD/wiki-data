==Airports==
Sprites for airports:
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Airport sprites.png]]

'''Sprites:'''
*2633: Heliport.
*2634-2649: Ground tiles for modern airports.
*2650-2654: Buildings for modern airports.
*2655-2658: Hangars (Openttdw.GRF has more hangars).
*2659-2662: Fingers.
*2663-2664: Fences.
*2665-2675: Tiles for small airport.
*2676-2679: Animation sprites for windshook.
*2680-2691: Animation sprites for radar.
'''Tips:'''
*Small airport should be modeled in a single model without the hangar or windsock, and cut with GIMP (or Photoshop). Windsock can be modeled in a single model (it's animated). Modeling it in the same model than the airport would make the rendering of sprites too slow.
*The other airports doesn't have models, and they can made modeling the buildings one by one.
*The helistations shares a sprite with the [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Industrial Buildings (New Graphics)#oil-refinery-copper|oil refinery]].
*There aren't construction stages for these buildings, but the building of helistations (and oil refinery) has two construction stages.
*Fences are used in all airports and helistations.
