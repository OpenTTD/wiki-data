[[Translation:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Ground Sprites Automated (New Graphics)]]
This page documents the process artists must go through to create a set of ground sprites.
The Page should link to a number of Automated files.

== Step One ==
'''Downloading and understanding the files you will need.'''
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Files.png|left|frame|1. example file structure]] <br> The important files and folders that must be kept are '''Outlines, Outlines2, *.Blend,''' and if on windows with photoshop '''Black-AlphaZero.exe'''<br>
<br style="clear: left"/>

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Outlines.png|left|frame|2. Outlines]]
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Outlines2.png|left|frame|3. Outlines2]]<br>
Outlines the folder contains overlays used by blender to cut the renders, thus making the testilate fully. Outlines would be used for flat standard ground tiles.<br>
Outlines2 the folder contains overlays which just cut the bottom off, this lets things such a fields, shrubs, rocks etc... stick aobve the top of the sprite. for correct visual display both overlays may need to be used. (ask me "Alltaken" if that is the case)

'''Below are uneeded (example) folders'''

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Field1.png|left|frame|2.fields]]
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Field2.png|left|frame|3. fields2]]<br>
Fields one and Fields2 are optional folders (i created them as output folders for rendered ground sprites) these particular images used the outlines2 overlays to allow for the crops to go above the top of the sprite.
<br style="clear: left"/>

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Grass.png|left|frame|2.Grass]]<br>
Grass is the name of the folder i created to store my rendered "standard" grass tiles. (i.e. not with shores, not with rocks on them.....)  this could be named anything you like. i.e. you could name it desert, snow....
<br style="clear: left"/>

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Shore.png|left|frame|2.Shore]]<br>
the Shore folders, are fairly important, these are also part of the "Grass set" but are Shore tiles for it.  you could call the shore folders anything you like, but i adopted Shore-Shore3 refering to the water level and how far up the tile the water was ((for underwater sprites)
<br style="clear: left"/>

'''Black-Alphazero.exe''' is a droplet created for PS7 in windows, it functions as a method to remove the Black from rendered sprites and make it alpha (allowing testelation and correct overlaying) this needs to be done since blender outputs sprites with the Black overlays from outlines/outlines2.

'''Ground*.Blend''' (currently Ground2.blend version numbers will increase as the file is improved) this is the .Blend file that you will create your GFX in and render from, this handles most automation of things, and will make your job very quick if you use it correctly

== Step Two ==
'''Editing the file to create new items'''

i am not designing this tutorial to teach people how to use blenders basic features, i will however show people the more advanced functions which are '''required''' to create ground sprites.

for basic tutorials on things like texturing and blender navigation visit this page and work throught their tutorials. http://blender3d.org/cms/Using_Blender.80.0.html

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Openscreen.png|right|frame|2. Opening screen]]<br>
This is the Opening screen that most users should see when they open the ground*.blend file.  The left pane is the 3d window and should be looking through the camera, the right view is the sequencer, and can be removed for most things you need to deal with, but may be required towards the end of your modeling/rendering process.  the bottom pane is your Button panel with all the functions you need to edit textures and other settings. (as you should know from your tutorials)

=== Layers ===


[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Layers.png|left|frame|2. Layers]]<br>
First and foremost, the layers of the files should be interesting to you.<br>
'''layer 1''' is the standard ground sprites. these are used for rendering combinations 1-85 of the normal ground sprites, (i.e. no shores, no rocks, no added stuff)<br>
'''Layer 2-5''' are the various shore height layers, these contain a plane at the water level height which will cut the ground at water level and not render anything below that level (do not touch these large planes unless you know what you are doing)<br>
'''Layer 10''' contains all the lighting, this layer will need to be turned on when rendering to get any colour.
'''Layer 11-12''' currently contains farmland sprites. this layer could be edited by users to contain rocks, shrubs, cows, holes, caves.... (whatever might be on a ground sprite)<br>
''All the rest''' feel free to do as you wish with them
<br style="clear: left"/>

----
===Objects===


[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Objects.png|right|frame|2. Objects]]<br>
The objects that we are presented with on the front screen as as follows.
'''lattice''' the deforming lattice controls the deformation of the ground sprites which are children of it. this must NOT be edited (unless you know exactly what you are doing) as it provides the shape to the sprites when they are rendered, this is one of the most important elements of the automation process.<br>
'''Ground object''' the Ground object can be edited and messed with freely, this is what we will be seeing when rendering,  please '''don't delete''' this object, unless you know how to parent a new object to the lattice.<br>
'''Frame reference cube''' This is a reference to show the user how large objects can be to still be rendered within the camera frame.  you will notice that on layers 11, and 12, the rows of plants are within this bounding frame.
<br style="clear: right"/>

===Editing linked objects===


[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Editing.png|left|frame|2. Editing]]<br>
The file is Automated so that if you edit one Object, "All" (or most) objects within that layer will be equally edited.  this means 85 sprites can be edited with a single opperation, the limitations of this (with current blender releases 2.37a) is that you cannot use Sub Surf on your items. 
if you are wishing to edit individual tiles, then you will need to create new objects, or split the mesh data (you will need to learn how to do that yourself)

== Step Three ==
'''Rendering your images'''

== Step Four ==
'''Cutting your images out'''

== Step Five ==
'''Using photoshop or GIMP to apply alpha'''

== Step Six ==
'''Cropping sprites and packing Sprites for game use.'''
