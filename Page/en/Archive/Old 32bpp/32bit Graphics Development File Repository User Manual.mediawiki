[[Translation:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit Graphics Development File Repository User Manual]]
Early March 2009 saw the release of a public file repository for the [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit Graphics Development]] effort. The repo was written and is hosted and administered by Jupix. He takes suggestions and advice at [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=42293 tt-forums].

==Authentication required==

The repository requires authentication for all actions, including read actions. We use the '''guest:guest''' login for those. Write actions require individual registration. (If you sign up for read/write access, you can obviously use your account for browsing.)

In registering, please use the username you use at the forums. Password can, and should, be different.

Because write access to a file server is serious business, the repository features a robust verification system for making sure the user attempting to register has an account at tt-forums. The way it works is, it basically tries to post a PM to yourself containing a link back to the registration script with a unique activation key which must be checked is correct in order for the account to become active. For you to get through registration, you need to have an active cookie at the forums, so before registering, make sure you have logged in at tt-forums with the "always log me in" tickbox checked.

For a step-by-step tutorial on registering, read on.

==Normal mode and edit mode==

Basically, the site can be browsed in two modes: normal, and edit mode. Toggling between them is done via a link next to your log out link, at the top of the site.

In the former mode, you have a pretty much identical UI to the guest:guest login. You can browse, but cannot change anything. In the latter, you get form fields to edit everything you have clearance to. All write actions are stuff that is done in edit mode. So if you want to add files, edit notes, whatever, you need to engage edit mode.

The philosophy behind this is that most of the time you will be checking for recent activity at the repository, and want as little clutter in the interface as possible, so basically, you want normal mode by default. And that is how it currently is.

For a step-by-step tutorial in how stuff is done, read on.

==What does it do?==

In short, it hosts files, and writes a list of them by request.

Jupix posted, ''"It is a really simple piece of code, only about 1200 lines of code in fact. It is an excercise in my software development philosophy of "less clutter, more productivity"."''

It allows us to do what we need, which is to:

* Add files.
* Rename files.
* Delete files.
* Examine logs of the above. Specifically: when files were added, when they were updated, how many times they have been updated and who maintains them.
* Browse files.
* Browse categories of files.

==Version numbering==

It's pretty pointless to tack on "0.9" or "2.1" or such to our stuff, isn't it. We never know when our graphics are "1.0". Still, we need some sort of version numbering to keep tabs on whether we are looking at the latest content. Therefore the repo uses a simple integer, starting from one, and automatically increments that each time a file is revised. So versions will go 1, 2, 3, and so on as content is updated.

==I am an artist. I've got lots of files. What should I upload?==

A Jupix quote again:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic">
Short answer: everything.

Now, that is my opinion on this. I can't make requirements. However, this is what I would like:

All artists upload all content related to all their development work into the repo. It doesn't matter if it's unfinished, it doesn't matter if it's unpolished or if that coal truck only has 1 wheel modeled. The point is, if the work-in-progress dies, someone can eventually continue with the work. That is one of the goals I'd like to achieve with this project. Get stuff off of people's hard drives and out into the open, where they can be developed openly. That is the true spirit of open software development, and that is what we must strive for.

But all that time, I was talking about modeling. Now, what about sprites? Whether they're unfinished or finished, polished or not, upload them all. Title them accordingly. Allow the development process to consume your work and grow on it. Allow players to explore the repo and try stuff out. It'll all work in our favour in the end. I'm absolutely sure of it.
</blockquote>

==Is this for standard zoom or extra zoom?==

For now, the initial period of "seeing how the repo goes", we have 3 "classes" of sprites: standard zoom sprites, extra-zoom sprites and sprite packages compatible with both. Jupix wishes that before summer all active 32bpp development work is being done on sprite packages containing both standard and extra zoom sprites.

==User's manual==

===Registering===

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-1.png]]

Enter the repository and click '''register an account'''.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-2.png]]

Enter your desired credentials. Note that it is recommended you use your ''tt-forums'' user account name, with a different password.

At this step, you should open a new browser tab and navigate to tt-forums. Once there, log out and log in, making sure you have '''Log me on automatically each visit''' ticked:

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-6.jpeg]]

Once done, click register.

At the next step, read the instructions on your screen, they are important. Click "go to tt-forums".

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-3.jpeg]]

Now at tt-forums, click "preview" to get a clickable activation link, or "send" to save the message in your inbox for nostalgia. 

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-4.png]]

Either way, you now have a clickable link. Click it.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-5.png]]

You can now log in using this form.

===Adding files===

First, you need a read/write account, so you need to register - see above. Once you have - log in.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-addfile-1.png]]

Enable editing mode using the circled link. Navigate to your category of choice.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-addfile-2.png]]

The file upload form is at the bottom of the category view. Fill it and submit, and you're done.

Some further notes on adding files: sprites or .blends, whatever the upload, it needs to be either a .zip or a .tar. Screenshots need to be .png or .jpg. Screenshots are GOOD! Please use the feature and upload screenshots.

Also, make good use of the "notes" field. Any and all information on licensing, recent developments, basically all that has been going on at the forums about this particular file, needs to go here. After all, the repository is for ridding ourselves of the need to search the forums for information on stuff related to graphics development.

===Managing your files===

The file view in edit mode, image below, has four basic controls for managing files. To see them on a file, you need to be the designated owner. We'll denote different features with colors.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-fileview.png]]

The red form allows you to re-title a file. This will not rename the physical file.

The yellow form allows you to remove a file completely from the server. '''There is no confirmation window.''' The activity history of the file will be preserved.

The green form allows you to transfer all ownership of this file onto any other user account with read/write clearance. You will be stripped of ownership.

The blue form allows you to update the notes and/or screenshot on a file, neither of which will increment the version number of a file entry. It also allows you to revise a file (upload a new version). Doing this will increment the version number by one.
