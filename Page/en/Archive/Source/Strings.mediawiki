This page is about the strings/language from a developers point of view. When you want to translate, please look at [[en/Archive/Source/OpenTTDDevBlackBook/Format of langfiles]] for a more in-depth article about translating and how to support for example genders and plurals.

You add a new string by adding a line to '''"english.txt"'''. This should happen at the place where it belongs with the other strings around. Keep in mind that sometimes OpenTTD uses special code for the numbering of strings. For example you SHOULD NOT put anything else in between the dates: ''"1st"'', ''"2nd"''... ''"31st"''. These strings are '''not''' called by their name, but iterated through from within the code with a counter. '''Keep this in mind!'''

==Adding Strings==
You add a string by giving it an identifier, something starting with ''"STR_"'' then a number of spaces later a colon ":" and then the string itself. For example:
<pre>STR_01A1_IS_GETTING_VERY_OLD   :{WHITE}{STRING} {COMMA} is getting very old</pre>
The strings enclosed in "{}"'s are special character strings that are interpreted by the game. As you might have guessed, "{WHITE}" gives the string a white colour.

==How to use these?==
As you have seen before, you have to put these special modifiers into the string itself. Let us revisit the above example:
<pre>STR_01A1_IS_GETTING_VERY_OLD   :{WHITE}{STRING} {COMMA} is getting very old</pre>
Both "STRING" and "COMMA" are variables. You set them up by calling the appropriate '''"SetDParam(uint n, uint32 v)"''' function. So for this one you would do:
<pre>SetDParam(0, _vehicle_type_names[v->type - 0x10]);
SetDParam(1, v->unitnumber);</pre>
Only after that you call the appropiate draw function, for example:
<pre>DrawStringRightAligned(x, y, STR_01A1_IS_GETTING_VERY_OLD, colour);</pre>
Both parameters of "STR_01.." have been set up, and you will get the info nicely on your screen. Good luck!
