A vehicle is one of the fundamental entities in the game.

==Types==
There are 6 recognised vehicle types in the VehicleType enum:
* VEH_TRAIN: A train or carriage. Makes use of a linked list for the carriages.
* VEH_ROAD: A bus or truck. Will probably use the same linked list for articulated vehicles.
* VEH_SHIP
* VEH_AIRCRAFT
* VEH_SPECIAL
* VEH_DISASTER

==Vehicle==
The Vehicle struct has many variables and methods. Some of the important ones are:
