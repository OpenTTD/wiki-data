OpenTTD works on [http://www.haiku-os.org Haiku]. These instructions worked for OpenTTD 1.9.0-rc1.

== Using HaikuPorter ==

You may want to use [http://github.com/haikuports/haikuports HaikuPorter]. It will download and compile the lastest stable version and all its dependencies. Once you have HaikuPorter configured, just write:

<pre>haikuporter openttd</pre>

Note: If you run Haiku hybrid with GCC2 as the default architecture (the default download) you need to write.

<pre>haikuporter openttd_x86</pre>

== Getting the source ==
<pre>git clone https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD.git</pre>

== Prerequisites ==

OpenTTD requires some libraries to be installed first. All of them can be installed from HaikuDepot or pkgman.

=== SDL ===

<pre>pkgman install libsdl_devel</pre>

=== lzo and lzma ===

<pre>pkgman install lzo_devel xz_utils_devel</pre>

=== Fluidsynth (optional) ===

 pkgman install fluidsynth_devel

=== MIDI SoundFont (optional) ===

If you want to hear music you'll need a MIDI soundfont. You can use TimGm soundfont.

<pre>pkgman install timgmsoundfont</pre>

== Compile ==

Now we're ready to compile OpenTTD. Go to the source tree and type

<pre>./configure</pre>
<pre>make</pre>

Now you may want to download and install [[en/Archive/Community/OpenGFX Readme]], [[en/Archive/Community/OpenMSX]] and [[en/Archive/Community/Sound Effects Replacement]].
