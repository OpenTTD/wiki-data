==Introduction==
This page will contain guidelines for compiling OpenTTD in Win32 with MinGW.

LKRaider has made a package that automates some steps of this tutorial. Check it out at this [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=24533 forum thread].

==Setting up MinGW==
# Copy the updated mingw.ini to the folder you downloaded the MinGW 5.0.2 install and un it.
# On the install, select <i>Candidate</i>, then select the <i>Minimal install</i> plus the <i>g++ compiler</i>.
# Run the MSYS install.
#* You will see the following messages after GUI:
#* {{en/Box|This is a post install process that will try to normalize between<br>your MinGW install if any as well as your previous MSYS installs<br>if any.  I don't have any traps as aborts will not hurt anything.<br>Do you wish to continue with the post install? [yn ]}} Input "y". 
#* {{en/Box|Do you have MinGW installed? [yn ]}} Input "y".
#* {{en/Box|Please answer the following in the form of c:/foo/bar.<br>Where is your MinGW installation?}} Input your MinGW installation path.  If you mistyped it, the best solution for newbies is to re-install MSYS.
# Unzip the SVN package into your user folder on MSYS (ex: c:\msys\home\YourUser)

==Setting up MSYS==
# Copy these files to your user folder: <u>.inputrc</u> , <u>.profile</u> and <u>get latest openttd.sh</u>. All three are included in this [http://www.tt-forums.net/download.php?id=47131 zip package].

==Testing the MinGW installation==
* Run MSYS.
* Run the following commands.{{en/Box|make -v<br>gcc -v<br>svn help}}
* They should output something.  Check if something goes wrong.

==Compiling zlib==
# Extract the mingwPORT code to a folder (ex: /home ), it will create a zlib-1.2.3 folder.
# Start MSYS.
# Run: {{en/Box|mkdir /usr/src<br>cd /home/zlib-1.2.3/mingwPORT<br>./mingwPORT.sh}} Answer the questions by just pressing enter.
# It will download zlib sources, compile and install them for you.

==Compiling pnglib==
# Extract the mingwPORT code to a folder (ex: /home ), it will create a libpng-1.2.8 folder.
# Start MSYS.
# Run: {{en/Box|mkdir /usr/src<br>cd /home/libpng-1.2.8/mingwPORT<br>./mingwPORT.sh}} Answer the questions by just pressing enter.
# It will download pnglib sources, compile and install them for you.

==Setup DirectX==
# Rename the devpak to directx90c.tar.bz2 and extract it.
# Copy the folders <i>include</i> and <i>lib</i> to where you installed MinGW (ex: c:\msys\mingw).
# Copy the contents of the DLL folder to the <i>bin</i> folder of MinGW (ex: c:\msys\mingw\bin).

==Compiling OTTD==
'''If you cannot compile, DON'T PANIC.  Sometimes it may be due to coding errors.'''

# Start MSYS.
# Run the <u>get_latest_openttd.sh</u> script to obtain latest OTTD source. [[en/Development/FAQ development#how-can-i-obtain-the-source-code|How can I obtain the source code?]]
# Change the working directory to the OTTD source folder ( /home/OpenTTD/trunk ).
#: Run: {{en/Box|./configure --with-png --with-directmusic}}
# Modify the <code>Makefile.config</code> file:
#: Change the following parameters: {{en/Box|1=INSTALL:=1<br>PREFIX:=home/OpenTTD<br>BINARY_DIR:=build<br>DATA_DIR:=build<br>ICON_DIR:=build<br>USE_HOMEDIR:=<br>PERSONAL_DIR:=/home/OpenTTD/build<br>SECOND_DATA_PATH:=data<br>CUSTOM_LANG_PATH:=lang}}
#: Some slots are made empty to disable.
#: Don't change the <code>Makefile.config</code> into Win32 txt format.  Otherwise all changes will be lost.
# Run {{en/Box|make && make install && make clean}} Some warnings may be shown, but they usually do not matter.
#: Note from DaffyDuck: I had to use the command <code>mingw32-make</code> rather than just make.
# The compiling is complete when the <code>openttd.exe</code> file is made. It will be copied to the /home/OpenTTD/build folder.

==Testing OTTD==
# Copy the following files from <code>(TTD)\data\</code> to <code>(OTTD)\data\</code>:{{en/Box|sample.cat<br>trg1r.grf<br>trgcr.grf<br>trghr.grf<br>trgir.grf<br>trgtr.grf}}
# Run <code>openttd.exe</code>.
# Enjoy!
