=Required software=
:* [http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/default.aspx Microsoft® Visual C++ 2008 Express Editions] ''(current: Final)''
:* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=529f03be-1339-48c4-bd5a-8506e5acf571 Microsoft® DirectX SDK - August 2007 or earlier] ''(only needed for DirectX Music, otherwise can be skipped. More later on.)''

:* [http://www.openttd.org/download-openttd-useful openttd-useful.zip] ''(current: 4.2)''
:** openttd_useful.zip is a collection of files of varying age. For the latest zlib, libpng, liblzo2 and FreeType files you can browse their websites below.

'' It is useful to read those Instructions, as they include some basic pre-requisites ( and it has pictures too )''

=Installing=
[[File:en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Microsoft Visual Cpp 2008 Express Editions.png|thumb|200px|Install screen]]

===Microsoft® Visual C++ 2008 Express Editions===
:If you just need to compile OpenTTD it's enough if you don't select any options, keep the default options and wait for the installation to finish (for illustration click the image).



===Microsoft® DirectX SDK===
If you don't want/need music, you can skip DirectX SDK. Please read next chapter on that.
:'''Install the version August 2007'''
:From the components screen remove the documentation and sample source code you'll save a lot of space. They're pretty useless if you just need to compile OpenTTD (see the image below). For those of you who don't want to download the whole DirectX SDK package with several hundred megabytes you can use this handy [http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=118839&sid=554843a58fb26683eeacb7642ea2446d zip file] containg only headers needed for successfull OpenTTD compilation. You ''don't'' need the included dxguid.lib file for compiling trunk.
{{en/Note|You should not use a version newer then August 2007 as DirectMusic is no longer support as of the November 2007 release. If you install a newer version, you should follow the instructions of [[http://wiki.openttd.org/wiki/index.php/Microsoft_Visual_C++_2008_Express_Editions#Microsoft®_DirectX_SDK_earlier_than_August_2007 Microsoft® DirectX SDK earlier than August 2007]]}}

:As August 2007 or earlier installer doesn't support Microsoft® Visual Studio 2008, you will have to set up the VC++ directories manually.

:Go to <code>Tools -> Options</code>, then to <code>Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories</code>. Add the following lines:

:Include files:
:* C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK\Include

:Library files:
:* C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK\Lib\x86

:'''Note:''' Please update the paths as necessary.

===Without Microsoft® DirectX SDK===

: '''Alternative''': If you are willing to compile without support for MIDI music you will not be needing the DirectX SDK. To disable music, open the "openttd" project properties dialog and:
:* Navigate to <code>Configuration properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions</code> and remove <code>WIN32_ENABLE_DIRECTMUSIC_SUPPORT</code> preprocessor definition.
[[File:en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Preprocessor.png|thumb|none|200px|Preprocessor settings]]

:* Navigate to <code>Configuration properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies</code> and remove <code>dxguid.lib</code> library.
[[File:en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Linker.png|thumb|none|200px|Linker settings]]

=Copying from OpenTTD needed includes and libraries=

:*Extract the [http://www.openttd.org/download-openttd-useful openttd-useful.zip] file and copy the content to some <code><personal folder></code>.
:*In the guide below: Don't forget to replace <code><personal folder></code> with the folder where you extracted openttd-useful.zip.

==== Visual C++ Express 2008 ====
:*Now you need to tell Visual C++ where the files are located. In Visual C++ Express 2008, navigate to ''Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > VC++ Directories'':<br />
:**Select Platform '''Win32''' (Be sure that all your entries are '''before''' any SDK folder!):
:***Select '''Include Files''', press the new folder button and add the folder <code><personal folder>\'''shared'''\include</code> to the list. <-- note the ''''shared'''' and not 'win32'
:***Select '''Library Files''', press the new folder button and add the folder <code><personal folder>\win32\library</code> to the list.
:**Select Platform '''x64''' (Skip if it isn't available! Again be sure that all your entries are '''before''' any SDK folder!) :
:***Select '''Include Files''', press the new folder button and add the folder <code><personal folder>\shared\include</code> to the list.
:***Select '''Library Files''', press the new folder button and add the folder <code><personal folder>\win64\library</code> to the list.<br />

==== Visual C++ Express 2010 ====
:In Visual C++ Express 2010 the options are set in a different way:
:*Right click on the '''openttd''' project in the Solution Explorer and choose Properties.
:*Choose VC++ under '''Configuration Properties'''
:*Click on the dropdown next to '''Include Directories''' and choose '''edit'''.
:*Click the 'New Line' icon at the top, and add the folder <code><personal folder>\'''shared'''\include</code> to the list.
:*Repeat for '''Library Directories'''

=Subversion=
===Getting the client===
[[File:en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/SVN Checkout.png|thumb|400px|The SVN Checkout Box]]
Subversion is needed to download the source (the place where to find the MSVC project file. If you want an easy, GUI subversion client, download and install [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads TortoiseSVN].

===Make the directory===

Make a directory called "ottdsrc" in your C:\ drive. It is important to make a directory without spaces since [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on Windows using MinGW]] (the program used later for [[#bundle|making a bundle]]) can only switch to directories without spaces. This will be used as a place to download the source to.

===Download the source===

To download the actual source of OpenTTD, right click inside the folder <code>C:\ottdsrc</code>, then go to '''SVN Checkout'''.

In '''SVN Checkout''', make sure you have the url of the OpenTTD trunk source (svn://svn.openttd.org/trunk) in the "URL of Repository" box.

To get the latest revision, get the HEAD Revision. To get an older/different revision, highlight the "Revision" box and type in the revision number you want specifically. For now, you can just download the HEAD revision, unless you need another revision. This takes about 5-20 minutes depending on your internet.

=Compiling=
A compile can take anywhere from ~5 minutes to ~20 or more minutes depending on how fast your system is. The "generating code" part at the end takes the longest (about 20% of the entire compile), so do not close MSVC because it looks like it has stopped.

'''Debug''' (Debugging crashes only):
:* Open <code>projects/openttd_vs90.sln</code>. This will open your IDE with the project loaded.
:* Go to <code>Build -> Configuration Manager</code> and check if it is set to <code>Debug</code>. By default, it should be.
:* Right-click on openttd (project) -> Properties -> C/C++ -> -> General -> Additional Include Directories. Add the DirectX headers subdirectory (Usually, <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (August 2007)\Include</code>)
:* Press <code>F7</code>, or go to <code>Build -> Build Solution</code>.
'''Release''' (Recommended):
:* Open <code>projects/openttd_vs90.sln</code>. This will open your IDE with the project loaded.
:* Go to <code>Build -> Configuration Manager</code> and select <code>Release for OpenTTD</code>.
:* Right-click on openttd (project) -> Properties -> C/C++ -> -> General -> Additional Include Directories. Add the DirectX headers subdirectory (Usually, <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (August 2007)\Include</code>)
:* For '''Win32''':
:** Right-click on openttd (project) -> Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories. Add the DirectX SDK Lib subdirectory (Usually, <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (August 2007)\Lib\x86</code>)
:* For '''Win64''':
:** Right-click on openttd (project) -> Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories. Add the DirectX SDK Lib subdirectory (Usually, <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (August 2007)\Lib\x64</code>)
:* Make sure to press ''Apply'' then press ''Ok'', this is important.
:* Press <code>F7</code>, or go to <code>Build -> Build Solution</code>.

=Bundle=

This is not necessary in compiling OpenTTD, only if you want to upload your binary publicly. The purpose of this article is to get the equivalent of a "<code>make bundle</code>" for MSVC builds. {{en/Note|You must have MSYS or Cygwin installed for this to work. To get MSYS, follow [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on Windows using MinGW#setting-up-mingw|this guide]]. You only need to use the part which says "Setting Up MinGW", "Setting up MSYS" and "Install SVN", then you are good to go. Note that when installing MinGW, you do ''not'' need to install the g++ compiler, but you still need to install the candidate.}}
You will first need to change the directory to your OpenTTD source. Use this command to change directory: <code>cd <directory></code>. To change to your new source directory, type <code>cd /c/ottdsrc</code>

Then, enter the command:
<pre>make -f Makefile.msvc bundle PLATFORM=WIN32</pre>
Replace <code>PLATFORM=WIN32</code> with <code>PLATFORM=x64</code> if you compiled a 64-bit build.

After this is done, you can find the contents in the <code>/bundle</code> directory. From there, you can make a zip/rar out of the files. Remember, TT-Forums.net[http://tt-forums.net] only allows files that are less than or equal to 6 MiB.

=Running/Debugging the game=

Make sure you have either the [[en/Manual/Installation#files-from-ttd|original game files]] or our free alternatives [[en/Archive/Community/Sound Effects Replacement]] and [[en/Archive/Community/OpenGFX Readme]] placed in ~\Documents\OpenTTD\data\ , that way they're shared by all your OpenTTD installations and you don't have to copy them to every new installation.

=Microsoft® DirectX SDK earlier than August 2007=

Information: The DirectX SDK from November 2007 is the first one which supports Microsoft® Visual Studio 2008. But it's also the first version which doesn't support DirectMusic which is needed to compile OpenTTD. That is why we must copy the missing files from an older version, prefered the final one for DirectMusic: 'August 2007'.

* Extract (no double-click, do not install) dxsdk_aug2007.exe in an extra directory and you get a file called dxsdk_aug2007.exe (yes that's right, both files have the same name).
* Extract the second dxsdk_aug2007.exe in an extra directory.
* Now copy following 9 files from .\dxsdk_aug2007\dxsdk_aug2007\Include\ to <personal folder>\shared\include (note: Please update the paths as necessary):
:* dls1.h
:* dmdls.h
:* dmerror.h
:* dmksctrl.h
:* dmplugin.h
:* dmusbuff.h
:* dmusicc.h
:* dmusicf.h
:* dmusici.h
