This article gets you started on compiling OpenTTD using Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.

==Required software==

You will need:
* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/download/ Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0BAF2B35-C656-4969-ACE8-E4C0C0716ADB&displaylang=en Microsoft Platform SDK]
* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=529f03be-1339-48c4-bd5a-8506e5acf571&DisplayLang=en]
* [http://www-d0.fnal.gov/d0dist/dist/packages/d0ve/devel/windows/AFXRES.H afxres.h]
* [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103924&package_id=114307 Openttd-useful.zip]
** openttd_useful.zip is a collection of files of varying age. For the latest zlib, libpng and FreeType files you can browse their websites below.
** [http://www.zlib.net/ zlib]
** [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617&package_id=16183 GnuWin32 libpng]
** [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/freetype.php GnuWin32 FreeType]

...and of course the newest source from <code>svn://svn.openttd.org/trunk</code>. You have to have a SVN-client to download the source. Pick either of the following two. For SVN novices TortoiseSVN is highly recommended:

* [http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91 Command line version (Subversion 1.3.2 Win32 binaries)]
* [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/download.html GUI TortoiseSVN]

'''Note:''' This guide has been made on Windows XP (with VTP applied). There are known problems with the DirectX & Platform SDKs on Windows 2000, and nothing is known about Windows Vista. Us it at your own risk!

==Installing==

* Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition. This should be fairly easy. Download it, run it and drink a beer while waiting ;)
* Install Microsoft Platform SDK. I recommend to install the same options way I did, so it won't use a lot of unnecessary space (see the images below).
* Follow step 3 and 4 of the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/ installation instructions for the SDK].

==Setting up includes and libraries==

Now extract the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103924&package_id=114307 Openttd-useful.zip] file and copy:

* The contents of the <code>include</code> folder and [http://www-d0.fnal.gov/d0dist/dist/packages/d0ve/devel/windows/AFXRES.H afxres.h] to <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include</code>.

* The contents of the <code>library</code> folder to <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\lib</code>.

==Setting up the DirectX SDK==

Well, from the components screen remove the documentation and sample source code you'll save a lot of space (800+ MB). They're pretty useless if you just need to compile OpenTTD.

==Setting up the VC++ Directories==

Go to <code>Tools -> Options</code>, then to <code>Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories</code>. Add the following lines:

Executable files:
* C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Bin

Include files:
* C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include
* C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK\Include

Library files:
* C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK\Lib\x86
* C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib

'''Note:''' Please update the paths as necessary.

One more step is needed to make the Win32 template work in Visual C++ Express. You need to edit the <code>corewin_express.vsprops</code> file (found in <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCProjectDefaults</code>) and change the string that reads: <code>AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib"</code> to <code>AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib"</code>. That's it!

==Compiling==

Open <code>projects/openttd_vs80.sln</code>. This will open your IDE with the project loaded. If you want to compile a debug version straight ahead, press <code>F7</code> and enjoy. To compile a non-debug version, go to <code>Build -> Configuration Manager</code> and select <code>Release for OpenTTD</code>. Press <code>F7</code>.
