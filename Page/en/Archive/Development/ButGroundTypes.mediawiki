== Motivation ==

The various NewGRF that were created for NotRoadTypes revealed several downsides with the current NRT specification:
* Roadtypes are mostly used to change the visual appearance of the ground and walkways. Roadvehicle compatibility is neglible.
* There is little use in tram types.
** When used together with road, the tramtype hardly matters. It only affects a few pixels. Catenary, 3rd rail, that's about it.
** When used alone, the same requirements for ground/walkway apply as for roadtypes.
* Catenary is a problem. Do road and tram share their catenary? Are they exclusive?
** If catenary is shared, does upgrading road to trolley road also upgrade tram to electrified tram?
* Different speed limits for road and tram on the same tile are pointless when the movement is shared.

So, in summary, the issues arise in areas shared by road and tram on a tile:
* Ground
* Sidewalks, decorations
* Catenary, conversion/upgrades
* Shared movement implies shared speed limit.

Maybe the essential problem of NotRoadTypes is that it puts a main focus on RoadTypes.


== Idea ==

The focus is NotRoadTypesButGroundTypes.

Split road stuff into four parts:
* Groundtype: Defines the shared properties.
** Ground
** Sidewalks, decorations
** Pedestrian access (house grow along)
** Speed limit
** Can forbid road or tram.
* Roadtype: Defines roadvehicle compatibility.
** Defines overlay sprites. Empty for default ROAD.
* Tramtype: Defines tramvehicle compatibility.
** Defines overlay sprites.
* Catenary

Groundtypes are meant to complement infrastructure with surrounding eye-candy.
While they are introduced for road and tram for now, they also make sense for rail tracks and even canals. (think: fences, hedges, noise barriers, ... general eyecandy)
However, the focus is on "infrastructure" being present on the tile and occupying most of the pixels. This makes groundtypes distinct from NewObjects and NewLandscape.

Since most stuff is define by the groundtype, it's unlikely that there will be need for more than a hand full of road- and tramtypes. (just to give an order of magnitude)
This has little technical implications but is important for the UI design: Many groundtypes, few road-/tramtypes.


=== Catenary ===
* Catenary is weird.
** There is very little use in having different catenary graphics in a game.
** One could imagine road cantenary, tram catenary and shared catenary.
** Neither groundtype, roadtype or tramtype are suited to define custom catenary sprites.
** So, best solution seems to be a single global catenary, which is used for all electrified road- and tramtiles.
* By default catenary is shared. Converting tram between RAIL and ELRL also implies conversion between ROAD and ELRD, if present.
* The catenary providing NewGRF can define that road and tram are electrified independently. It's the problem of the catenary GRF to properly visualise and communicate this to the player.


=== Conversion and upgrades to road- and tramtypes, catenary complementing ===

Road- and tramtypes on a tile can be converted or upgraded.
* Conversions convert some type to some other type.
* Upgrades convert some type to a "better" type, which supports all vehicles which the old type supported.

Catenary-complementing:
* Every road- and tramtype defines whether the global catenary shall be drawn for them.
* Every road- and tramtype references a "catenary-complemented" road- and tramtype to which the type converts when catenary is added or removed, or whether there is no such type. Adding catenary must be an upgrade.
* If the global catenary is shared, then conversions and upgrades to either road or tram which add/remove catenary also convert/upgrade the other road/tramtype to their catenary-complement. If no catenary-complement is defined, the conversion/upgrade fails.
* If the global catenary is not shared, then conversion and upgrade to road and tram to not affect each other. Catenary-complements have no meaning then.

For town-owned roads only upgrades are allowed.

Implications:
* Building ELRL on ROAD converts the road to ELRD. Removing tram again leaves ELRD behind.


=== Conversion of groundtypes ===

* The groundtype can be converted, if the groundtype allows the present road and tram.
* Conversion does not affect the present road- and tramtype.
* Conversion of town-owned tiles is generally allowed.

Note: Speed limits are no criterion for/against changing the groundtype of town-owned tiles. This is different to bridges.

TODO pedestrian-access should be a criterion?


=== Default/built-in ground-, road- and tramtypes ===

By default OpenTTD provides these types:
* Roadtypes: ROAD, ELRD (catenary-complemented)
* Tramtypes: RAIL, ELRL (catenary-complemented)
* Groundtypes: DFLT? (sidewalks depending on townzone, underlay depending on "with road"/"tram only", no speed limit, pedestrian-accessible also in case of "tram only")
* Shared catenary
* Vehicles: Road vehicles default to ROAD, tram vehicles default to ELRL.

ROAD, ELRD, RAIL and ELRL can be redefined/overridden by NewGRF, but can't be disabled.

TODO suitable class label and class name for the default groundtype


=== Town constructions ===

Towns grow along pedestrian-accessible tile.

Towns only build ROAD. If catenary is shared and electrified tram is already present, then ROAD is catenary-complemented to ELRD.

Implications:
* Town grow along tram-only tiles and branch-off with road-only, which results in a disconnected road network.


=== Map array storage ===

Neither ground-, road- or tramtype are stored directly in the map array.
Instead each tile references a combined-type.
The combined-type is dynamically added to a global pool, when needed, and references ground-, road- and tramtype.

That is:
* There is no explicit limit for either ground-, road- or tramtypes.
* There is a limit on the ''used'' combinations (combined-types) of ground-, road- and tramtypes per game.
* Using 8 or more bits per tile, we can reference 256 or more combined-types.


=== Vehicle interaction ===
* Vehicles have a road- or tramtype. This defines their minimum requirement for the track.
* Vehicles can query the present road- or tramtype in VA2, and adjust their specs/visualisation. (minimum: road, bonus: electrified road)
* Since road-/tramtypes are not directly stored in the map, it is easy to add "non-constructable" road-/tramtypes like "either catenary or 3rd rail" for additional compatibility rules.


=== GUI ===

There is (again) only one road/tram construction button in the main toolbar.
The dropdown contains the most recent used combinations of groundtype and road- or tramtype.

[[File:en/Archive/Development/Butgroundtypes gui.png]]

The road/tram construction bar has these additional elements:
* Label for current groundtype.
* Button to select new groundtype.
* Button for convert groundtype.
* Toggle for road/tram construction.
* Dropdown for road/tram type. (only constructable ones)
* Button for convert road/tram type.

Selecting a new groundtype is similar to station/object selection.
The groundtype selection window can be kept open or closed during construction and conversions.

TODO Behaviour if groundtype forbids road/tram:
* Option 1:
** Road/tram selection is switched to the supported type.
** Road/tram toggles are disabled.
* Option 2:
** Road/tram selection is switched to the supported type.
** Selecting the unsupported type switches the groundtype to "default".


=== Behaviour of construction tools ===

Build road/tram on empty land:
* Use selected groundtype.
* Build road or tram according to road/tram toggle and road-/tramtype selection.

Add road/tram bits to existing road/tram tile:
* Keep present groundtype.
* Road-/tramtype:
** Use the selected road-/tramtype, if it is an upgrade to the present one.
** Use the present road-/tramtype, if it is an upgrade to the selected one.
** Fail if selected and present road-/tramtype is incompatible.
** The catenary-complementation rules apply for the other road/tram part.

Remove road/tram bits:
* Keep present groundtype.
* Keep present road-/tramtype

Depot construction:
* TODO Are there visual selections for depots???
* TODO Can depots be shared between road and tram?

Station construction:
* Same rules as for build road/tram or add/remove road/tram bits.

Bridges:
* Groundtype applies to bridge ramp ground tile, and can differ after conversion.
* TODO Bridge-surface has no ground type???
* Otherwise same rules as for build road/tram or add/remove road/tram bits.

Tunnels:
* Groundtype applies to tunnel entries, and can differ after conversion.
* Otherwise same rules as for build road/tram or add/remove road/tram bits.

Convert groundtype:
* See above

Toggle road/tram:
* Dropdown content is swapped. Selected is the most recently used road-/tramtype.
* Various captions and icons are swapped.

Convert road-/tramtype:
* See above


=== Other GUIs ===
* Autoreplace has a single filter dropdown which lists both road- and tramtypes, also listing non-constructable ones. (like in NRT)


== Details ==

=== Road/tramtype labels and compatibility ===

Mostly same as in NRT. Additional:
* Shared catenary and catenary-complementing road-/tramtypes.

=== Sprite layers ===

The tiles are composed using
* Grass from baseset
* Underlay from groundtype
* Overlays from road- and tramtype
* Roadsides from groundtype
* Catenary from global catenary
* Other stuff (oneway, ...) from baseset.
