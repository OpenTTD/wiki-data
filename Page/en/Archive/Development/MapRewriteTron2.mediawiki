An interesting idea by Tron, where he states that only a GroundTile needs the groundstuff. This way only the ground-tiles use 128 bits, all others 96. The only downside is that the union-structs are restricted to 6 bytes max, and there can be only 16 of them. We already had trouble stuffing 'this junk' into 7 bytes, but 6 will just pretty much kill off any future expansion ideas. (Darkvater)
