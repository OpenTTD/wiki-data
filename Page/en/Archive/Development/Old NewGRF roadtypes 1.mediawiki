This work is in parallel with [[en/Archive/Development/Railtypes|rail types]].

==Road type labels==

These work in the same way as cargo labels.
The default road type labels are:

* ROAD
* TRAM

By default, with no translation table in place, ROAD and TRAM are used.

This changes with a translation table, and the selected road type is used directly. If the roadtype is unavailable then the vehicle becomes unavailable.

The translation table is loaded by action 0, feature 8, property 13.

===Roadtype fallbacks===
Testing of different road types can be provided by use of action 7:

 Action 0: Install table consisting of ROAD TRAM TRAC
 Action 7: Skip next line if HWAY exists
 Action 0: Install table consisting of ROAD TRAM ROAD

This will cause road vehicles of the third rail type to be HWAY if that type exists, or ROAD if it doesn't, allowing some flexibility.

==Road type translation table (action 0, feature 8, property 13)==

This is a list of labels and works in the same way as cargo translation tables.

This is an example table that sets up four road type translations:

 1 * 30      00 08 01 04 00 13 "ROAD" "TRAM" "HWAY" "TRAC"

==Road type properties (action 0, feature 11)==

{|
|-
||Property||Format||Description
|-
||08||dword||Label
|-
||09||word||Name of roadype, from Action 4 string (Action 4 *MUST* appear before railtype definition)
|-
||0A||byte (dword ...)||Compatible road type list (list of labels, turned into a bitmask internally)
|-
||0B||byte (dword ...)||Powered road type list (list of labels, turned into a bitmask internally)
|-
||0C||byte||Toggle drawing of catenary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes, use global sprites, 2 = Yes, use custom sprites.
|-
||0D||byte||Acceleration model: 0 = rail, 1 = maglev, other models available?
|-
||0E||byte||Curve speed advantage, format to be decided
|-
||0F||word||Max speed limit in mph*3.2 (approximately 1/2 km/h) (To be decided)
|}

In NFO, road type IDs will be GRF local, with an ID to label mapping. Therefore to modify an existing road type, specify its label in property 08. To create a new road type, again just specify its label in property 08. This way there is no need for complex GRM mechanisms to allocate IDs. If a label 'clashes' with another GRF, then one GRF will end up modifying the properties instead of creating a new road type.

==Road type Action3/2/1 scheme==

===Action 1===

Just a regular action 1 for sprites.

===Action 2===

Like normal, used to assign sprites from action 1 to 'cargo ids'. There are no variables for road types.

===Action 3===

For road types the cargo type byte specifies the type of sprites being assigned. These are as follows:

{| border = "1" cellpadding="4"
!'Cargo' type!!Sprite type!!Number of sprites
|-
|}

Not all types need to be defined, if the type is not going to be used anyway.

Executing a varaction for every road tile would probably be quite slow, so for the moment it is done once on starting a game. For this reason, no global varaction 2 variables should be used.

==Action 7/9 additions==

{|
|-
||Condition||Description
|-
||0F||Skip if the road type label is not defined
|-
||10||Skip if the road type label is defined
|-
|}
