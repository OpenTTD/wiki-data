===1.2.0-RC1 (2012-02-19)===

* Feature: [NewGRF] Customisable tunnel portals for rail types (r23952)

* Feature: [NewGRF] Support for RealSprites with multiple zoom levels (r23890)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Support for container version 2 (r23887)
* Fix: Refittability should never depend on the current capacity of a vehicle {{en/Flyspray|5070}} (r23965)
* Fix: Do not look for missing sprites twice during startup {{en/Flyspray|5072}} (r23963)
* Fix: [Script] Infinite recursion within a script was not caught properly, so they could cause crashes of OpenTTD instead of the AI {{en/Flyspray|5068}} (r23962)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Make the properties for always/never refittable cargo types not behave incremental, but reset them on reassignment (r23960)
* Fix: [Network] Do not allow chat messages from pre-active clients. As they have not got the savegame yet, they will not have the interface to send them either (r23958)
* Fix: [Network] Allow sending chat to pre-active clients as the clients start accepting once they send 'map ok' to the server, which is the same moment we change their status to pre-active {{en/Flyspray|4990}} (r23957)
* Fix: When the population of a town changes the town view might even have to change size due to different cargo requirements {{en/Flyspray|5062}} (r23953)
* Fix: [NoGo] Never show GSGoal::Question() to spectators {{en/Flyspray|5063}} (r23950)
* Fix: Better rounding when converting internal speed to displayed speed (r23945)
* Fix: Also list DEITY signs in the signlist in the scenario editor {{en/Flyspray|5061}} (r23943)
* Fix: Infrastructure cache of standard road stops would get messed up when buying a company with them (r23942)
* Fix: Scale infrastructure cost of rail tracks by the total number of all tracks and not independently for each rail type (r23931)
* Fix: [Script] Do not close the parameter window when a script starts {{en/Flyspray|4944}} (r23930)
* Fix: Do not accelerate, for smoke purposes, when you reached the track's maximum speed {{en/Flyspray|5053}}
* Fix: 32bpp animated blitter was optimised a bit too far regarding not needing to update the colour mapping when (re)initialising the palette {{en/Flyspray|5056}} (r23927)
* Fix: [NoGo] Some news messages would cause an assertion to be triggered due to a missing proper location for the viewport of the news message, so only allow building when valid data for the viewport is provided or no viewport is used {{en/Flyspray|5054}} (r23924)
* Fix: Consider only the middle tile of a lock for lock-infrastructure costs. The other two tiles may be owned by other companies. Also do not count the middle tile of a lock as canal, independent of whether it is build on ground or river slope (r23920)
* Fix: [NewGRF] When determining the first refittable cargotype according to CTT order, do not rely on the GRF assigning the refit_mask property. Also check for GRFs setting the default_cargo or refittable-cargo-classes or -types properties (r23916)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Do not test validity of cargobits using a mask of cargoslots (r23914)
* Fix: [NewGRF] When testing whether a engine shall only carry the default cargo, check ctt_include_mask for being empty before applying cargo translation (r23912)

* Fix: Memory leak everytime one clicked a savegame in the load GUI (r23901)
* Fix: [NewGRF] It was not possible to import sounds from a NewGRF later in the load order (r23883)
* Remove: PNG sprite loader; use 32bpp sprites in a NewGRF (r23898)

===1.2.0-beta4 (2012-02-04)===

* Feature: [NewGRF] Give NewGRF defined level crossings and rail depots access to the townzone (r23866)
* Feature: [NewGRF] New algorithm (activated via an engine flag) to determine the capacity of vehicles. This allows vehicles to better control the capacity for cargotypes which they know; and let cargo NewGRFs influence the capacity for cargos the vehicle NewGRF does not know, but which the vehicle is refittable to due to cargo classes (r23861)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add cargo property 1D to set the capacity multipliers when refitting vehicles, which do not use callback 15 (r23860)

* Fix: Railtype overlays were drawn 'only transparent' on invisible bridges (r23864)
* Fix: Inserting conditional orders for ships checked the wrong orders wrt. maximum distance (r23859)
* Fix: Out of bounds read for slowdown parameter caused desync when railtype >= 4, vehicles were fast, and the original acceleration model was used {{en/Flyspray|5007}} (r23855)
* Fix: Infrastructure cache could get out of sync when overbuilding a drive through road stop (r23851)
* Fix: When the network is lagging, you try to copy a vehicle's order but accidentally create a station order and then copy the vehicle's order (before the first command is executed) one could trigger an assertion from the pool {{en/Flyspray|5008}} (r23849)
* Fix: When removing road or tram from a tram+road stop, the owner of the road stop's cache was updated instead of the owner of the removed infrastructure (r23847)

* Fix: Clear NewGRF vehicle cache when their owner changes (r23841)
* Fix: Assertion got hit when destroing a dock when a ship was loading {{en/Flyspray|5000}} (r23838)

* Fix: [Network] Missing naming of some errors {{en/Flyspray|4963}} (r23780)
* Fix: Trim all control codes and the likes from strings being passed into the AI. If the AI would be displaying them later we would be showing those control codes as question marks {{en/Flyspray|4957}} (r23778)
* Fix: Hide the PCX screenshot format from the options window, if a 32bpp blitter is used (r23775)

* Fix: Missing locking causing crash is extreme case when being in the MP lobby {{en/Flyspray|4938}} (r23752)
* Fix: [Win32] Work around a possible deadlock when initialising threaded drawing (r23749)
* Fix: Make vehicle variables A8 and A9 always return 0. Returning cur_image is a potential desyncer due to Action1 in static NewGRFs (r23748)
* Fix: Also set 'info' to NULL if 'instance' dies (for both AI and GS); avoids invalid memory reads (r23746)
* Fix: If autorefit fails, count the vehicle capacity nevertheless, if it is already carrying the right thing (r23745)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Check the version of the right GRF {{en/Flyspray|4923}} (r23744)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Call CB 15E for all vehicles before actually executing any refit {{en/Flyspray|4906}} (r23743)

* Fix: Ships going to wrong dock location when moving the dock while the game is paused {{en/Flyspray|4927}} (r23717)
* Fix: The amount of goals was too low {{en/Flyspray|4928}} (r23699)
* Fix: Hardcode the original defaults for loading old savegames if they could totally mess with the game's behaviour {{en/Flyspray|4859}} (r23693)
* Fix: Infrastructure count of canals/locks/ship depots was not updated properly when a company went into bankruptcy or was taken over {{en/Flyspray|4921}} (r23686)
* Fix: When fitting another engine the cargo capacity of wagons could become lower, causing them to contain more than they should. This caused the cargo transfer from the replaced parts to put even more stuff in the already full wagon. Prevent this from happening by reducing the amount of cargo in the vehicle to the capacity when moving vehicles/wagons around, or when autoreplacing {{en/Flyspray|4912}} (r23683)
* Fix: Vehicle numbers got misaccounted when autoreplacing failed due to length checks {{en/Flyspray|4914}} (r23681)
* Fix: [AI] Prevent removal of the (AI) company the local player is in {{en/Flyspray|4915}} (r23680)

* Fix: [Script] Invalidate AI Parameters window when changing AI {{en/Flyspray|4909}} (r23677)
* Fix: When removing road stops the wrong tile was checked for updating the infrastructure cache {{en/Flyspray|4913}} (r23676)
* Fix: [Script] The 'Configure' button in the 'AI / Game Configuration' window did not get enabled when activating a GameScript (r23668)
