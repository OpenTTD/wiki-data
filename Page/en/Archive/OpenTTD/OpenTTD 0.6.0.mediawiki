* Fix: Tiles were not marked dirty in some cases when removing a lock or flooding (r11582, r11604)
* Fix: Make price for railtype conversion more realistic; conversion should not be more expensive than removing and rebuilding [FS#1481] (r11603)
* Fix: Do not allow changing network only patches settings from console when not in network game (r11594)
* Fix: IsSlopeRefused() result was half wrong causing banks to be built on wrong places (r11590)
* Fix: When ship depots got destroyed they always returned to water, even when it should have been canals [FS#1514] (r11589)
* Fix: The one way road button wasn't reset on abort (r11587)
* Fix: Windows could get completely missing when one resized the window to something very small [FS#1484] (r11583)
* Fix: Invalidate 'list trains/roadvehs/ships/planes' widgets when station part is added/removed so it does not become glitchy (r11577)
* Fix: Flood train stations when there are no trains on border tiles too (r11574, r11570)
* Fix: Reinitialise windows system before loading a savegame because not doing so can cause crashes [FS#1494] (r11572)

* Fix: Cargo translation was sometimes done when it should not be done [FS#1501] (r11544)
* Fix: [OSX] Detect statvfs at runtime (based on OSX version) instead of compile time. This should prevent a crash on OSX 10.3 with the precompiled binaries (in the load/save windows) (r11541)
* Fix: [OSX] Do not try to compile the quartz video driver on OSX 10.3 as it will fail (r11540)
* Fix: Do not do all kinds of 'updates' for town, waypoint, station and other signs when you have not converted the map to the 'current' format as that means you are going to read data in the 'old' format when you assume that it is in the 'current' format, which is eventually going to break (r11525)
* Fix: Assertion when tram reversed at a station [FS#1485] (r11524)

* Feature: Auto-road; same as auto-rail, but for road and trams and only on X and Y direction (r11339)
* Feature: OTTD version checking for NewGRFs. This allows NewGRFs to do something different for different versions of OpenTTD, like disabling it for too low versions or loading different graphics (r11330)
* Feature: Half tile* and anti-zig-zag-foundations (r11319)
* Feature: Control-Clicking the Centre Main View button on the vehicle window allows the main viewport to follow the chosen vehicle (r11304)
* Feature: User customisable faces (r11269)

* Feature: Sort the NewGRFs by name, making searching a specific NewGRF a lot easier (r11175)
* Feature: Add possibility to show the bounding boxes of sprites using CTRL-B so one can get a better understanding of the used bounding boxes to fix the glitches that still exist. Note that showing the bounding boxes is not glitch free; it only gives you some knowledge where the bounding boxes are (r11174)
* Feature: Remove the arbitrary limit of 10 articulated parts for a vehicle (r11120)
* Feature: Autoslope, changing of slopes of tiles that already have something build on them. Does not work for tiles of houses/industries/stations that do not allow autosloping (r11107)
* Feature: Support for encapsulating files into a .tar file; you can pack all files in your data/ directory in how ever many .tar files you like, keeping the directory-structure equal to the unpacked version, and OpenTTD can handle them just like the files were unpacked (r11106)
* Feature: Allow slopes under statues (r11069)
* Feature: [OSX] Added more options for right click emulation (controlled from the interface tab in the patch window) (r10996)

* Feature: Added TileHeight to the Land Area Information tool [FS#653] (r10878)
* Feature: [OSX] OpenTTD will now pick the same language as finder is set to if no config file is found (r10851)
* Feature: Provide an infrastructure to have resizable windows that are smaller than the default window size. Useful for playing on very low resolution systems (r10704)
* Feature: Support for autosave_on_exit in the console, so dedicated servers can use it (r10658)
* Feature: Add a soft limit of 4096 "entities" in a station's waiting queue and a hard limit of 32768 so (malicious) people cannot cause a "denial of service" attack by filling cargo lists (r10555)
* Feature: Replace all the windows for Industry building by a more flexible one (r10496)
* Feature: Support for "prospecting" raw industries, i.e. you pay an amount of money and then it might (with a given chance) build a raw industry somewhere on the map (r10451)
* Feature: Automatic signal completion, enabled by pressing CTRL when dragging signals. Signals will continue following track until an existing signal, junction or station are reached. This currently replaces the existing use of CTRL-drag for changing existing signal type (r10437)
* Feature: New sign editor features including switching to previous/next sign (r10401)
* Feature: Disallow (in the GUI) the building of infrastructure you do not have available vehicles for. This means that the airport building button is disabled till you can actually build aircraft. The game itself will not disallow you to build the infrastructure and this "new" behaviour can be overridden with a patch setting [FS#669] (r10353)
* Feature: Add the possibility of automatically filling in timetables based on the times from the first (or subsequent) run-throughs (r10331)
* Feature: Option to select the "default" rail type when you start a new game or load a game. This is done either static, i.e. rail, electrified rail, monorail and maglev, or dynamic which takes either the first or last available railtype or the railtype that is used most on the map [FS#812] (r10329)
* Feature: Give a better explanation why the loading of a savegame failed and do not crash on loading savegames that were altered by patches or branches [FS#917] (r10300)
* Feature: A sticky button for the client list window [FS#885] (r10293)

* Feature: Allow building new stations adjacent to existing stations by holding down control (r9905)
* Feature: Add one new zoom-out level: 8 times (r9884)
* Feature: Advanced vehicle lists a.k.a. group interface. Now you can make groups of vehicles and perform all kinds of tasks on that given group (r9874)
* Feature: Make "improved loading" a proper improved loading instead of loading one (semi-)random vehicle at a time. Furthermore fill multiple vehicles at once when there is enough cargo to do so (r9838)
* Feature: Add drag and drop removal of station tiles (r9810)
* Feature: Support for "curvature info", Action 2 for train, variable 45 (r9803)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add action 1, 2 and 3 support for canals (r9797)
* Feature: Add the possibility to choose different road patterns for towns to use (r9779)
* Feature: Add an option to automatically pause when starting a new game (r9734)
* Feature: Add the concept of cities. A (configurable) proportion of towns can start off larger, and will grow twice as quickly as other towns (r9667)
* Feature: Add NewGRF Action 5 (Sprite Replacement) support for 2cc colour maps, airport, and road stop sprites (r9645)

* Feature: Make it possible to have some control over the town growth (r9613)
* Feature: Add list_patches console command. This shows all patches along with their current values (r9565)
* Feature: Add more finer control to transparency options, including a new toolbar (r9563)
* Feature: Add support for variable snow lines in the arctic climate, supplied by NewGRF files (r9371)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for newhouses (r9315)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for Action 13, which allows you to translate GRF-specific texts. The translations will only be shown if you are using a language with a GRF language id and if a string has not already been set specifically for the language you are using (r9037)
* Feature: Translation dependant formatting of dates (r8906)
* Feature: If an action 7/9 leads to skipping the rest of the file, disable the NewGRF if an action 8 has not been encountered yet (r8831)
* Feature: Stop loading and disable the current NewGRF if a fatal error message in Action B is encountered. Also be more strict on the values accepted (r8830)
* Feature: Build aircraft windows will no longer show aircraft that cannot use the airport in question (r8771)
* Feature: Drive-through road stops (r8735)
* Feature: Allow upgrading bridges by building a new bridge over the top (r8567)

* Feature: Increase sprite limit from 16384 sprites to 16777216 sprites (r8128, r8129)
* Feature: Add the ability to load savegames when you do not have the exact GRF files in your list. GRF files that are found based on GRF ID (but not on matching md5sum) are used instead of disabling them. This does not affect MP games, there you still need an exact match (r8106)
* Feature: Show the activated status of the GRF list after pressing 'apply' in the NewGRF window, instead of the local list (r8094)
* Feature: The station list does now remember the sort settings (r8065)

* Feature: Add support for tractive effort to 'realistic' acceleration (7592)
* Feature: Allow to build bridges of arbitrary rail/road combinations (including signals) (r7573)
* Codechange: Do not allow configuration changes, that NewGRFs can directly use to change their behaviour, during network games as this can cause desyncs (r11452)
* Codechange: Make opening a new toolbar not overlapping its parent one, by locating it under the parent, and aligned with the left side of it [FS#1310] (r11256)
* Codechange: Do not brute force determine the first vehicle in the chain or previous vehicle, but do it by properly accounting the previous and first pointers when updating the next pointer. This gives a performance increase of about 15% when there are a lot of vehicles in the game (r11011)
* Codechange: Cache expensive NewGRF station variables during sprite lookups/callbacks (r10509)
* Codechange: Keep track of the origin, time of travel and accumulated feeder share (transfers) of individual pieces of cargo. This means that cargo is not thrown on a big pile when it is put in a station or unloaded at a station, however the GUI does not reflect these changes yet so you will not actually see it (r10266)
* Codechange: Do not limit the cost of tunnels (r10248)
* Codechange: Add new vehicle hash table for collision detection and finding vehicles on a tile. The hash area scanned is far smaller than the old hash table, which is now used for viewport updates only. This should give a significant performance improvement for games with many vehicles (r10111)
* Codechange: Don't redraw all station tiles when cargo is added or removed if the station has no custom graphics (r10062)
* Codechange: Add some support for NewGRF var 7D, temporary storage array (r9707)
* Codechange: Add support for returning 'ttdpatch variables' (Action D) (r9701)

* Codechange: Add support for multiple 'base' directories for NewGRF searching (r9560)
* Codechange: Implement actions 1/2/3 for cargoes, callback handler and custom icon sprites (rmany)
* Codechange: Rename the 'New <vehtype>' button of the global vehicle lists to 'Available <vehtype>' as it is a view-only list, not one from which you can purchase (rolling) stock (r8420)
* Codechange: Remove the landscaping button from the build toolbars (r8143)
* Codechange: [NewGRF] Do not mark as unsafe those NewGRFs that set their own parameters (via action D) and/or change only bridge sprite table layouts (action 0, property D) (r7831)
* Fix: The CHANCE16 functions were biased; a 32768 in 65536 chance was really a 32769 in 65536 chance (r11454)
* Fix: Do not create shores in canyons (r11438)
* Fix: Starting OpenTTD with DOS files made it look weird out of the box (r11433)
* Fix: Properly support genders coming from NewGRFs instead of crashing [FS#1430] (r11422)
* Fix: Do not ignore the autorenew settings for new games when creating a new game [FS#1428] (r11415)
* Fix: Do not do a 270 degree turn when 90 degrees is enough on a commuter airport [FS#1422] (r11408)
* Fix: In rare cases OpenTTD could segfault when resizing and scroll the main window (r11405)
* Fix: Manually replacing a vehicle with shared orders makes it lose it is order index and service interval [FS1384] (r11370)
* Fix: Road vehicles must not drive through each other on bridges/in tunnels [FS#1258] (r11366)
* Fix: When stopping a ship or aircraft, set their speed to 0 so they will not continue at the speed where they were stopped at [FS#1288] (r11365)
* Fix: Cloning vehicles with non-standard sub-cargotypes (i.e. livery refits) failed [FS#1380] (r11362)
* Fix: Loading too many GRFs was not handled gracefully causing crashes and such [FS#1377] (r11355)
* Fix: Add missing elrail sprites for some rail build buttons/cursors (r11350)
* Fix: Trees can now be planted on bare land without making it grassy, planting tree in desert does not make it grassy for the first tile-cycle and when a tree dies in desert, it no longer becomes a snowy tile for the first tile-cycle (r11244)
* Fix: The explosion vehicles were placed too far to the south [FS#1312] (r11234)
* Fix: One could sell vehicles that were crashed in a depot, which would still yield money/one could construct trains of crashed vehicles [FS#1307, FS#1228] (r11229, r11230)
* Fix: Electric trains were not shown as stopped in depots when converting it from elrail -> normal rail [FS#1260] (r11167)
* Fix: A lot of graphical glitches by changing some bounding boxes. It is not perfect yet, but a *very* good step into the right direction (r11128)
* Fix: When autorenew is enabled and it cannot renew the vehicle anymore (because the player cannot build the engine), the ageing warnings as if autorenew is not enabled are shown [FS#553] (r11064)
* Fix: Inconsistency between rail<->elrail conversions of different kinds of rail containing tiles (normal rail, stations, depots, etc) [FS#1182] (r11059)
* Fix: Crash when having the Finance window opened of the player you are cheating to [FS#1177] (r11028)
* Fix: Switching players (using the cheat) crashed on Big Endian machines [FS#1150] (r11023)
* Fix: The canal border determination did not take oil rigs into consideration (r11022)
* Fix: Do not display income/expenses when they do not belong to a "valid" tile, like the money cheat/giving money [FS#1175] (r11021)
* Fix: One could not give money when (s)he had too much money or rather: when casting the amount of money to an int32 becomes negative [FS#1174] (r11020)
* Fix: When determining the gender of a string, do not assume that the gender is in the front of the string when there can be case switching code at that location [FS#1104] (r10792)
* Fix: Determining whether there is a tunnel going under the lowered area is only needed in two directions instead of all four, so take the directions (one for each axis) to the nearest border (along the given axis) [FS#1058] (r10686)
* Fix: Graphical glitches when the "link landscape toolbar" patch is turned on when opening one of the construction toolbars [FS#1076] (r10685)
* Fix: Trolly AI did not know about steep slopes, and used wrong tileh in some cases [FS#1070] (r10655)
* Fix: Be consistent with the space between the company name and the player number, i.e. always put a space between them [FS#1052] (r10627)

* Fix: Do not segfault when you quit in the end-of-the-game screen [FS#1020] (r10548)
* Fix: When Cheat-Window is open and a new month happens, the window was not redrawn instantly (r10547)
* Fix: You can now have both Available Train as Available Ship window open [FS#1026] (r10546)
* Fix: Cargo payment rates overflow and cargo payment rates diverge from cost rates making it impossible to make any profit after a certain number of years. Both are solved by stopping the inflation after 170 years; there is absolutely no point in continuing the inflation after that as it only makes the game have overflows at some point that cannot be solved; using larger variables only delays the inevitable [FS#1028] (r10541)
* Fix: Error dialog was sometimes shown on all clients when a command failed instead of only the client that actually did the command [FS#1015] (r10501)
* Fix: The network protocol check for required NewGRFs sent static NewGRFs too (r10414)
* Fix: When landscape generating, allow for 200ms between screen updates instead of updating every 200ms. Previously slow screen updates would result in very slow map generation (r10396)
* Fix: One could only build a limited number of stations before one had to rename them [FS#278] (r10320)
* Fix: Acceleration not calculated properly when a train goes up a hill between tunnels [FS#786] (r10317)
* Fix: [YAPF] Now it is no longer needed to invalidate the YAPF segment cache every tick in MP (read performance increase). Segment cost now does not contain the curves between segments. As a result the cache should be now accurate (r10302)
* Fix: [YAPF] Assertion triggered in some special cases [FS#901] (r10301)
* Fix: Flush stdout on dedicated server output to ensure an update of stdout [FS#775] (r10295)
* Fix: With smooth_economy, when industry production hit 32, it stayed there for ever. Give it some chance to get out of that uber-lowness (although it is a very slim chance, at least it has one) (r10290)
* Fix: Also age engines that are not front-engines [FS#202] (r10288)
* Fix: Money overflow bugs in many locations [FS#723] (r10212)
* Fix: Fix issues related to fixed names, fixed places of files/directories and application bundles [FS#153, FS#193, FS#502, FS#816, FS#854] (r10182)
* Fix: A vehicle without visual effects is not per definition unpowered (r9802)
* Fix: Do not assume that trains running on monorail/maglev cannot smoke/spark (r9801)
* Fix: Play sound effects based on the engine class, not the rail type (r9800)
* Fix: Separate engine class and engine running cost class (r9799)
* Fix: Clone vehicles will no longer refit for free (r9689)
* Fix: Improved loading does not use a huge amount of processing power anymore when having a lot of trains [FS#423] (r9683)
* Fix: Truncate the NewGRF information text in the NewGRF GUI if it is too long (r9449)
* Fix: Cancel in password queries reduces amount of players in the network game when they have not joined the game yet [FS#688] r9378
* Fix: If all news-setting buttons show 'full', make the ALL-button show 'full' too (r9137)
* Fix: Open and close messages now have their own setting, so you can hide economy changes, but do show open/close of industries [FS#525] (r9097)
* Fix: Do not make owner signs transparent, as then you loose the information who it owns [FS#637] (r9067)
* Fix: Store the owner of a statue, so when it gets removed, the town is notified of it [FS#638] (r9066)
* Fix: Inactive connections are not automatically kicked, i.e. people who only open a telnet (or similar) connection to a server [FS#115] (r9038)
* Fix: Do not select a disabled platform length/number of track count when going out of drag-drop mode [FS#450] (r8999)
* Fix: Make an aircraft at 400 km/h go as fast as a train at 400 km/h (r8973)
* Fix: You were unable to build roads in the scenario editor when there is no town 0, even though there are other towns (r8608)
* Fix: Road Vehicles now can obtain a slot even if the station is very spread out [FS#577] (r8536)
* Fix: Allow lumber mill to cut trees only when they are full grown (r8535)
* Fix: Segmentation fault when the toolbar gets removed and you have selected one of the items in a sub menu of the toolbar (r8533)
* Fix: Remove phantom oil rigs sometimes present in old savegames (r8485)
* Fix: When a station is removed, vehicles do not get excessive payment any longer, as the origin TILE is now stored as long as the origin STATION for the transported cargoes (r8144)
* Fix: The game could crash when the chat key (<ENTER>) is pressed too vehemently during the join of the game. Your client's id does not exist in the clients list yet, and returns NULL (r8132)
* Fix: Rail vehicles can no longer enter tunnels or bridgeheads with wrong railtype (r7976)
* Fix: When path finding onto a bridge or tunnel end from previous tile (but not warping from the opposite end) check the enter direction. This fixes signal setting if a rail ends on the top of a tunnel end (r7718)
* Fix: When following path for signals, do not skip back to the previous tile, as for tunnels and bridge ends the entering direction is wrong (r7717)
* Fix: [YAPF] suppress 'Train is lost' message if path finding ended on the first two-way red signal due to YAPF.rail_firstred_twoway_eol option (r7628)
* Fix: [OPF] signal update was incorrectly propagated (r7620)
