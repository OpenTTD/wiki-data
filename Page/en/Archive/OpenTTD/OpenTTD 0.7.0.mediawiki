[http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=42389 Forum topic]

* Feature: Pop up the AI Debug Window if one of the AIs crashed and show a message that the user should report the crash [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2728 FS#2728] (r15708)
* Feature: Allow the number of towns that will be generated in the generate world window to be customized [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2672 FS#2672] (r15695)
* Fix: Enabling freeform edges could cause submarines to get stuck on land tiles (r15733)
* Fix: Centering on a vehicle did not respect its z coordinate (r15725)
* Fix: Do not show passenger-/mail-capacity if the aircraft carries only cargo (r15705)
* Fix: Blame NewGRFs returning inconsistent information in purchase-list/after building before users have a chance to blame OpenTTD for incorrectly autorenewing/-replacing [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2595 FS#2595] (r15701)
* Fix: Just sell the old engines after autorenew/replace. Do not bother about trains exceeding the trainlimit, which will be sold anyway [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2721 FS#2721] (r15692)
* Fix: Do not crash when the generate map does not contain a suitable location for a town [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2720 FS#2720] (r15689)
* Fix: Do not crash when someone substitutes the "map generation" sprites with garbage [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2720 FS#2720] (r15685)
* Fix: Vehicle images would be determined during the process of moving the vehicle which means that only the (orientation) data for the vehicles in front of it is valid. Now the data for the vehicles behind the vehicle are valid too [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2546 FS#2546] (r15677)
* Fix: It was possible to remove rail tunnels/bridges and aqueducts build by rival companies [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2718 FS#2718] (r15667)
* Fix: Sorting of engines in the purchase list did not use the same numbers as the GUI showed, e.g. articulated parts were not taken into accound when ordering by capacity [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2689 FS#2689] (r15666)
* Fix: Handling of aircraft crash counter did not take account of the reduced number of calls (from 6 down to 2) to the aircraft event handler, resulting in crashed aircraft taking three times longer than they should to clear. Compensate by increasing the counter by 3 on every call instead of 1 (r15665)

* Feature: [NewGRF] Allow a grf to customize house name via callback 0x14D, during Tile Inquiry process (r15172)
* Feature: Downloading content from a central server (content.openttd.org) where authors can upload their NewGRFS/AI etc. This should make joining servers that use only NewGRFs that are distributed via this system easier as the players can download the NewGRFs from within the game. It should also make it easier to see whether there are updates for NewGRFs and make the necessary updates (r15126)
* Feature: Add support for IP range bans using CIDR notation (r15094)
* Feature: An AI framework so people can write their own AIs. This also removes the old cheating and heavily broken AI (r15027)

* Feature: Allow road vehicles to move multiple steps in a tick (code based on train movement code) and add support for RV prop 15. This gives RVs a maximum speed of 318mph instead 79mph. This only implements higher speeds, not 'realistic acceleration' (r14869)
* Feature: Automatic reversing in front of block signals can now be disabled by setting pf.wait_oneway_signal respectively pf.wait_twoway_signal to 255 (r14852)
* Feature: Few (optional) optimisations to making (initial) orders; like keeping goto selected [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1984 FS#1984] (r14827)

* Feature: Arrow key scrolling in the server list (r14517)
* Feature: Initial support for handling bidirectional scripts and connecting Arabic characters (r14479)
* Feature: Allow sorting vehicles by remaining life time (r14352)
* Feature: Ability to reset name to default/automatic value (for vehicles, engines, towns, groups, stations, waypoints, managers and companies) (r14334)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add Variational Action 2 Variable 0x47 for houses, Coordinates of the house tile (r14294)
* Feature: Allow overriding the palette of the base GRFs. This way you can play with NewGRFs made for the Windows palette with the DOS palettes base GRFs (and vice versa). Note that for this to work correctly ALL NewGRFs must use the same palette; mix and match is not yet supported (r14229)
* Feature: Double click to join selected server/company (r14209)
* Feature: Allow both the German as well as non-German toyland graphics as "correct" and official graphics (r14197)

* Feature: Make it possible to choose between the DOS and Windows graphics packs while retaining the possibility to override the palette (r14151)
* Feature: Increase the size of the console backlog. Now it'll only remove backlog items when there are more than a threshold and when they are there longer than (another) threshold (r14056)
* Feature: Make it possible to filter list_patches output like it's done for other list_* console commands (r14041)
* Feature: Path based signalling (r13926-13967)
* Feature: Show [total-]cargo info in depot when [ctrl-]right-clicking on vehicle (r13923)
* Feature: NewGRF presets, selected by a drop down list in the NewGRF window. Presets are saved in the config file (r13781)
* Feature: Add a few extra columns with information to the server list (r13732)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 65 in Variational Action 2 Variables for Houses (r13603)

* Feature: Aqueducts (r13464)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 0x69 for industries, long format construction date (r13443)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add long format introduction and maximum construction year for house (r13437)

* Feature: Splitting of the main toolbar when the resolution becomes very low so the buttons are still visible and useable (r13339)
* Feature: Make news messages use a linked list instead of a moving circular buffer. This makes it possible to store more news messages in the history (r13317)
* Feature: The number of news messages is reduced by removing every news message that is a configurable amount older than when it would not be shown in the newspaper popup/ticker, which is e.g. a month for industry production changes and half a year for subsidy offers. As a result the more important messages will stay longer in the message history (if longer than 30 messages) (r13317)
* Feature: Allow to have more than only two airports per town.  The number of airports is now controlled by the noise each of them generates, the distance from town's center and how tolerant the town is (13226)
* Feature: Introducing the so called 'engine pool' which primarily removes the fixed engine type limits and also happens to allow (with the patch option 'dynamic_engines') multiple NewGRF vehicle sets to coexist (r12924)

* Feature: Ability to force a vehicle to not load or to not unload at a station (r12650)
* Feature:  Four different non-stop types, individually selectable per order. Replaces "TTDP compatible order" setting (r12648)
* Feature: Three different load type in a single game instead of two. One can choose full load all and full load any instead of full load being governed by the "full load any" patch setting (r12648)
* Feature: Financial and Player Selection Face windows are now remembering their position when toggling sizes (r12634)
* Feature: Show what cargos a station could be supplied with (r12596)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add random action 2 type 84. For vehicles only (r12452)

* Feature: Open the time table when pressing the order button while pressing the CTRL key (r12441)
* Feature: On Screen Keyboard for input fields so someone without a keyboard can enter text too [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1846 FS#1846] (r12425)
* Change: When checking for unique names, compare only with manually set names [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1923 FS#1923] (r14958)
* Change: Apply the 'warn if train's income is negative' setting to other vehicle types, too (r14835)
* Change: When loading games in "network" mode use the start date of the save game for the server and all clients when loading the NewGRFs instead of the current date. Prevents desyncs caused by action 7/9s skipping parts of the GRF based on the date or some other variables that can differ at NewGRF load time (r14769)
* Change: Only say a engine/vehicle is refittable when it can be refitted to at least two cargo type or when it has subcargos (r14683)
* Change: [NewGRF] Since our NewGRF handling is better than it used to be, disable a NewGRF if unexpected sprites are reached (r14184)

* Fix: Deadlock (with wide fonts) or desync when generating manager name (r15279)
* Fix: Close all windows *before* starting a new game/loading a game instead of doing that as one of the latest steps of loading the game. This caused, in some cases, the NewGRF settings to be reset when the game was already loaded resulting in instant desyncs when joining a network game [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2577 FS#2577] (r15256)

* Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a NewGRF from loading if it contains multiple Action 8s (r14979)
* Fix: Wrong defaults for service interval when switching between service interval in days and service interval in percentages [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2508 FS#2508] (r14959)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Building new station parts did not allocate a new station spec effectively breaking variable 41. This was due to the limited number of station specs that we can have per station. This fix makes newly build station parts create a new spec until one cannot allocate new station specs anymore and it'll revert to the old behaviour (sharing station specs) [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1832 FS#1832] (r14956)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Station specs did not get deallocated when building a new station part over them (r14955)
* Fix: Sharing/cloning/inserting of orders that the/a vehicle (in the shared list) cannot go to (wrong station type etc) [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1890 FS#1890] (r14954)
* Fix: The "animation state" of the bubbles was stored in a variable that was not stored in the savegame. Using a variable that gets saved in the savegame solves the desync and makes it a bit clearer [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2512 FS#2512] (r14931)
* Fix: Abort dragging of vehicles in the group window when they are deleted [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2500 FS#2500] (r14925)
* Fix: Do not unnecessarily reset the cursor, when a different vehicle is dragged (r14924)
* Fix: [NewGRF] First create all articulated parts of roadvehicles, then call callback 36 capacity, also call it for all articulated parts (r14903)
* Fix: Overflow of number of orders per vehicle [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2495 FS#2495] (r14830)
* Fix: Off-by-one causing possible out-of-bounds reads (r14811)
* Fix: In an MP game in SP mode no company would go bankrupt. Furthermore companies that passed the "bankrupt" period (4 quarters) would not go bankrupt when loading the game back in MP. Now any company that is in MP or not "currently controlled by the player" in SP will bankrupt [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1993 FS#1993] (r14750)
* Fix: Do not let any disaster vehicle (Helicopter or Airplane) target invalid industry (r14746)
* Fix: Memory leak in Action 0x0F (new town names) (r14737)
* Fix: Writing a single char to the config file caused reading outside a buffer (r14729)
* Fix: First transfer the whole load of a vehicle chain to industries before triggering any processing. This reduces callback usage and resolves critical rounding errors when using input-cargo-multipliers instead of production callbacks [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2460 FS#2460] (r14705)
* Fix: Zeppeliner (disaster) should target st->airport_tile, not st->xy (r14694)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Gradual filling graphics were not chosen according to the NewGRF spec [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2435 FS#2435] (r14678)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Check sprite size when executing action 6 (r14674)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Property 7 and callback 12 were broken for aircraft. Now callback 12 is properly called also for 'mail'. If the callback is not used, 'mail' uses 1/4 of property 7 (rounded up) [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2444 FS#2444] (r14672)
* Fix: Possible stack corruption when reading corrupted sprites [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2415 FS#2415] (r14610)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Return the current year as construction year for unfinished houses (r14608)
* Fix: [NewGRF] When callback 1E fails, use the standard random colour (r14605)
* Fix: The company ID is off-by-one with respect to the rest of the GUI in the cheat window [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2422 FS#2422] (r14603)
* Fix: The range for kicking/banning clients is based on the maximum number of clients, not the maximum number of companies [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2414 FS#2414] (r14588)
* Fix: Allow capacity callbacks (15, 36) to return zero capacity (r14578)
* Fix: Crashes when a NewGRF sends an invalid string [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2395 FS#2395] (r14563)
* Fix: Order pool seemed to look full when it was not as it only checked whether it was possible to allocate a new block of pool items instead of checking for free pool items (r14547)
* Fix: Do not deliver cargo to industries not inside station catchment area [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2138 FS#2138] (r14530)
* Fix: Allocate stub (empty) sound entries when loading an empty/corrupt/incorrectly sized sample.cat instead of making valid NewGRFs fail to load (r14527)
* Fix: Make sure trains stop at the end of a station; a 3/8th length train did stop 2/8th of it's length too early causing a 63/8th long train not to fit in a 4 tile station [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2379 FS#2379] (r14526)
* Fix: Small possible chance of desync due to sorting on pointer instead of by (station) index [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2348 FS#2348] (r14463)
* Fix: When a road stop gets moved make sure to update the destination of RVs going to that road stop [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2330 FS#2330] (r14446)
* Fix: Support for spaces in directories passed to ./configure [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1802 FS#1802] (r14440)
* Fix: Trains would sometimes move one time too often/little when moving from diagonal<->non-diagonal tracks [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1793 FS#1793] (r14436)
* Fix: Balance the monthly random industry changes, by introducing a daily random industry change [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1885 FS#1885] (r14332)
* Fix: Save the palette of the loaded NewGRFs in the savegame, so joining with a server using Windows palette will make a client with the DOS palette do palette conversion and (thus) not cause a desync (r14233)
* Fix: Glitches (alignment issues/inconsistent vehicle graphics) in original graphics (r14214, r14211)
* Fix: One could not get a list of vehicles sharing an order when the number of orders was 0; you could see that the vehicles had a shared order though [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2085 FS#2085] (r14097)
* Fix: Various assorted autoreplace issues/malbehaviours [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1264 FS#1264], [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2037 FS#2037], [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2038 FS#2038], [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2110 FS#2110] (r14083)
* Fix: The autoreplace gui showed vehicle types for replacement which CmdSetAutoReplace() did not accept (r14037)
* Fix: Automatically recalculate inflation if NewGRFs are changed and cargo types are added, so that cargo payment rates are correct [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/2074 FS#2074] (r13836)
