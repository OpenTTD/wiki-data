[[Translation:en/Archive/OpenTTD/Comparison of OpenTTD and TTDPatch features]]
{{en/Outdated|Comparison tables are substantially outdated, at least about work-in-progress.  This is only really of value as a historical document now.}}


'''Here you have a small comparative between OpenTTD and TTDPatch Features'''

If you are a regular '''TTDPatch user''', you will notice that many similar things are implemented differently in OpenTTD. Not all features are [[en/Manual/Interoperability|compatible]] with [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]].

| Routing restrictions at signals
| style="background: yellow" | WIP
| style="background: lime" |  Done
| The MiniIN restricts based on maximum speed, with global settings (fast/medium/slow). TTDPatch restricts based on one or more of power, weight, length, next order, maximum speed, and nearby signal status; combined with any combination of or, and, and xor; with per-signal settings.
|-
| Programmable Signals
| style="background: yellow" | WIP
| style="background: lime" |  Done
| Allows the User to restrict the passage of Trains based on the state of other signals, station platforms, etc. For example, if a Mainline signal is red, the branch line signal can be set to automatically go red and therefore allows Priority to be given to certain tracks.
