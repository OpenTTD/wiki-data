==Changelog==

===1.1.2-RC1 (2011-07-24)===

* Change: [NewGRF] Only allow access (via hotkey and menu) to the bounding box visualisation when NewGRF developer tools are enabled (r22675)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Disallow accessing variable 1B in network games due to desync reasons (r22682)
* Fix: Switching from a red to a white highlight (by switching to another tool) without switching the highlight mode (HT_RECT etc.) did not mark the selection dirty {{en/Flyspray|4670}} (r22649)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Parameters from NewGRFs were not properly parsed in all cases {{en/Flyspray|4599}} (r22648, r22630, r22629, r22628, r22627)
* Fix: GetSection() does not return a LockPart {{en/Flyspray|4678}} (r22645)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Disallow building NewObjects on water tiles owned by another company (r22643)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Disable the 'set parameters' button in the NewGRF GUI, if the GRF specifies to have no parameters and one would not be able to set any parameters anyway (r22642)
* Fix: Keep the previous owner of the upper and lower lock parts if they are built on existing water (r22638)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Airports should not expose the tile specific random bits of the north tile. Only airport tiles should access those (r22636)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Correctly reseed random bits of industries and industry tiles (r22635, r22634)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Implement variables 25 and 7F for railtypes (r22633)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Additional text in fund industry window is NewGRF supplied and thus should have a default colour (r22631)
* Fix: Also initialise _old_vds with newgame settings; TTD savegames do not contain these settings {{en/Flyspray|4622}} (r22626)
* Fix: Do not zero the orders of disaster vehicles when converting savegames {{en/Flyspray|4642}} (r22625)
* Fix: When closing an AI company the local player cheated to, we need to cheat him to another company {{en/Flyspray|4654}} (r22624, r22623)
* Fix: When closing down companies their shares in other companies must be sold even if share trading is disabled at that point of time (r22622)
* Fix: When asking the user to confirm an unsafe unpausing, there is no need to execute a command if 'no' is choosed. This also prevents crashing when clicking unpause while the confirm window is shown (r22621)
* Fix: Enforce refit orders to be 'always go to depot' orders; service-only and stop-in-depot orders make no sense with refitting {{en/Flyspray|4651}} (r22620)
* Fix: Consider the size of the vehicle sprite for the lineheight in the company GUI. This also makes the widget containing the sprite not skip drawing it, if the bounds of the widget are outside of the drawing area though the sprite actually needs drawing {{en/Flyspray|4662}} (r22619)
* Fix: When changing difficulty settings over the network, do not just reopen the difficulty window if any game options window is opened; instead invalidate them properly {{en/Flyspray|4653}} (r22618, r22617)
* Fix: [NewGRF] If callback 33 returns a value out of range, no sound effect shall be played {{en/Flyspray|4656}} (r22614)
* Fix: Use rotated heightmap sizes for reporting scaling problems {{en/Flyspray|4663}} (r22608)
* Fix: Do not show cargo accepted/produced in the new station window when no tiles are selected (mouse hovering a window or toolbar) {{en/Flyspray|4647}} (r22595, r22593)
* Fix: Add active NewGRFs to the list of available ones when selecting the empty preset {{en/Flyspray|4644}} (r22594)
* Fix: Reading of heightmaps with uncommon BMP formats failed due to uninitialised variables {{en/Flyspray|4645}} (r22592)
* Fix: PBS order forecasting modified the current order index in case of a goto-nearest-depot order and no depot could be found {{en/Flyspray|4641}} (r22589)
* Fix: Remove BaseStorageArrays from _changed_storage_arrays on destruction (r22583, r22551)
* Fix: Do not increment STL iterators after they have been invalidated (r22582)
* Fix: Do not lower the arrow buttons in the NewGRF/AI parameter windows if they are clicked when disabled (r22553, r22499)
* Fix: Clear airport persistent storage on construction/removal of airports (r22552)
* Fix: Possible crash when opening the airport build window for the first time {{en/Flyspray|4619}} (r22538)
* Fix: Replace the half small airport structure on the intercontinental airport with some grass {{en/Flyspray|3494}} (r22537)
* Fix: Documentation omission regarding admin protocol {{en/Flyspray|4632}} (r22536)

* Fix: The layout selectors of the airport build GUI did not latch properly (r22497, r22495)
* Fix: Callback result for airport layout name was incorrectly used (r22496)
* Fix: Airport preview sprite can depend on the layout, so update the cached SpriteID when the layout changes (r22494)
* Fix: Engine IDs for coal and mail wagons were swapped in the TTO savegame conversion {{en/Flyspray|4622}} (r22487)
* Fix: The caption of centered windows could be moved out of the main window and thus become inaccessible when resizing the main window (r22485, r22484)
* Fix: No client error packet was sent to the admin bots {{en/Flyspray|4585}} (r22384)

===1.1.2-RC2 (2011-07-30)===
* Fix: Cost of adding an extra road type to a bridge or tunnel was undercalculated {{en/Flyspray|4680}}, {{en/Flyspray|4681}} (r22700, r22699)
* Fix: Only insert cleared object tiles into _cleared_object_areas if clearing actually succeeds, else subsequential tests of the same tile will be skipped and considered successful {{en/Flyspray|4694}} (r22698)
* Fix: When building a house it could be built at the wrong place if multitile houses failed some tests (r22697)
