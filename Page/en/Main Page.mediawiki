The manual provides in-depth information on how to play.  If you are new to the game, our [[en/Manual/Tutorial/Main Page]] will show you how to set up your first transport route and continue expanding your network from there. 

If you've played Transport Tycoon before, you may like to read the [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/Changes from TTD|comparison of OpenTTD and Transport Tycoon Deluxe]] to see what's changed. If you've played [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] which contains some of the same improvements as OpenTTD, we also have a [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/Comparison of OpenTTD and TTDPatch features]].

Finally, for any general questions check the [[en/Archive/Community/FAQ]].

This section covers all aspects of non-graphics OpenTTD development. For those new to development, the [[en/Development/FAQ development|FAQ]] should answer any questions you have.  You can then move on to current [[en/Development/Main Page]] or helping out with [[en/Archive/Community/Internationalization|translation]] if you wish. 

You can see the [http://hg.openttd.org/openttd/trunk.hg/shortlog changelog] and read through the, [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=33 development section] of the forums or join our [[en/Development/IRC channel]] if you're interested in the current state of the project.<br>

We also compiled a list or [[en/Archive/Community/Todo list|wanted features]] if you're interested in starting to write patches for OpenTTD itself.

<div style="font-size:1.4em; font-weight:bold">Helping with the Documentation</div>
The OpenTTD documentation is stored and edited using this <em>wiki</em>. Feel free to start editing as soon as you feel you can, but '''read the [[en/Wiki/Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] first''', and make any tests in the [[en/Sandbox|Sandbox]].  

Visit the [[en/Archive/Community/Village Pump|village pump]] to discuss any major changes or additions to the documentation, or you can start right in on requests posted in the [[en/Requested Articles|article requests]]. Also:

*Some articles need smaller changes to satisfy our needs, and there is a [[:Category:en/To do|list]] of these.  If you don't feel up to writing full articles then this may be a better place to start. 

*There are also some articles that require more work before they can be called finished, and you can browse them in [[:Category:en/Articles to be expanded|Expand category]]. 

*Finally, there are articles concerning [[:Category:en/Current events|current events]] which will become outdated often - why not check the information in these is still current if you have a spare moment?
