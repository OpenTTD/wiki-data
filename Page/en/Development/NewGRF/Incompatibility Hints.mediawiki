[[Translation:en/Development/NewGRF/Incompatibility Hints]]


This page is dedicated to listing changes to NewGRFs which NewGRF authors should consider bumping the min_compatible_version to the current version of their newgrf as they have the potential to break the savegame and maybe even crash OpenTTD.

==What is (in)compatibility==
There are two kinds of compatibility:
* Changes which just add additional stuff to the NewGRF and don't influence any of exisiting things
* Changes which change the behaviour of existing things in a way that loading of a savegame works, but the game continues differently than with the previous version of the NewGRF. This is a grey area, but save to keep the compatibility maintained.
* Anything which results in a re-interpretation of the existing game state is incompatible. These are the important things to look out for

==Incompatible changes==

===General for all features===
* Changing or even removing the IDs of anything (changing (var)action2 IDs is safe)
* Changing the meaning of parameters (most often)

===Vehicles===
* Changing the length of vehicles
* Removing cargos from a vehicle

===Stations===
* Changing track / non-track state of tiles
* Changing track type of tiles

===Industries===
* Changing or removing an existing layout
* Changing or removing cargos

Thanks for this. I was just checking my web site in IE bcuaese I know some people still use it and those sounds were annoying the hell out of me. Christ, what a ridiculous browser! Thanks again for restoring a little peace and quiet.
