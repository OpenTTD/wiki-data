Similiar to the real world, there are four main directions in OTTD world (Fig 1).

However, the TTD world is built of many tiles which can be counted in four semi-directions: north-west (NW), north-east (NE), south-west (SW) and south-east (SE). They are called '''horizontal''' (SW to NE and vice-versa) and '''vertical''' (NW to SE and vice-versa) tiles.

Tiles counted from south to north (and vice-versa) or from east to west (and vice-versa) are known as '''diagonal tiles'''

Tunnels, bridges, airports, canals and roads can be built only on horizontal and vertical tiles (Fig 3). However, railway can be additionaly built in diagonal directions (Fig 4).
