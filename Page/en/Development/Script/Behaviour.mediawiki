==AI behaviour recommendations==

Here are some recommendations for AI behaviour. You can ignore them and still make your AI work, but if you want users to like your AI, it would be best if you stick to them.

* Your AI should have a setting to be more friendly, i.e. do not compete, or compete significantly less with other players for goods from industries serviced by other. For easy difficulty, the setting should be ON by default. Some people like competition, but not too much of a competition (novice players, for example, may be disappointed if they build some route and then AI outsmarts them and takes most of the cargo and profit by constructing a better route nearby). Advanced players wanting fair competition can keep this OFF.
* An AI set as friendly should never buy exclusive transport rights anywhere.
