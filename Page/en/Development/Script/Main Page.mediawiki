Welcome to the AI Development. Starting from 0.7.0 release it is possible for any user to create his own AI. Not only do we deliver a clean and simple API, we also allow you to make your AI in scripts. This should make it possible for anyone with a bit programming knowledge to make pretty good AIs. Also should it challenge people to build better AIs then the ones we had in 0.6. This page is all about telling you how to do it.

For all pages there is the rule: where examples are given, we will use Squirrel. We suggest everyone who wants to write an AI to read the Introduction as it will explain the basic concept.

== Source & binaries ==
As of April 1st, 2009 NoAI is available in the 0.7.0 release. This means, you can [http://www.openttd.org/en/download-stable get the latest stable release]. Alternately you can get the latest source code by [[en/Development/FAQ development#how-do-i-get-the-svn-version-then|checking out from]] OpenTTD SVN repository (svn://openttd.org), or get compiled version by [http://www.openttd.org/en/download-trunk downloading a nightly build].
