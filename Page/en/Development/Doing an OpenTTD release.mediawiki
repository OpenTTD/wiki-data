[[Translation:en/Development/Doing an OpenTTD release]]
Those things have to be done for each release:

==Prerelease==
* backport all the fixes

* run "make regression"

* update all release version strings, especially in the following files:
** readme.txt
** docs/openttd.6
** os/debian/changelog
** os/rpm/openttd.spec
** os/windows/installer/install.nsi
** os/os2/installer/make_installer.cmd
** src/ai/api/ai_changelog.hpp
* update changelog.txt
** sort order: Feature, Codechange, Fix then descending revision number
** format: - (Feature|Codechange|Fix): ([<subsection (like OSX)>])? <message> ([FS#XXX])? (rXXXXX)
** merge items that are solving a single goal
* update the known-bugs.txt

==Release==
* use 'svn checkout -N svn://svn.openttd.org/tags' to checkout the tags directory without all the files and directories in it (since we only need to add something to it.x)
* create the tag: svn cp svn://svn.openttd.org/branches/<major> <version> (or trunk in case of betas)
* merge standard release changes: svn merge -c 11869 svn://svn.openttd.org/tags/0.6.0-beta3
* replace all instances of 0.6.0-beta3 with the new version and 11869 with the revision that the tag will have (yes a revision in the 'future'); svn diff should not show 0.6.0-beta3 nor 11869 anymore.
** for non-beta/non-RC releases assertions need to be disabled in config.lib and the MSVC project files. Furthermore the 'release' bit needs to be set in rev.cpp.in.
* svn commit -m "-Release <version>"

==Post release==
* build the binaries and source archives
** MorphOS: tokai makes them
** OS/2: orudge makes them
** Rest goes via the compile farm

* put a news message on the website
* make a forum announcement
* update the IRC topic
* forwardport/merge the changes made in the prerelease
* for non-RC releases:
** update version on FlySpray (current->past, future->current, maybe new future)
** update NoAI API docs (add_tag.sh)
** create a wiki page and update the release history
** update wiki pages: [[Template:en/Version]], [[en/Manual/FAQ general questions#what-s-the-latest-version-of-openttd|FAQ General Questions]]
** Add the new version to bananas minimal/maximum version list

==After creating a branch for a new version==
* Add a new (empty) AI compatibility script in bin/ai/
* Add the new version to CheckAPIVersion in src/ai/ai_info.cpp + src/ai/api/ai_info_docs.hpp
* Add the new version to src/ai/api/ai_changelog.hpp
* Update the version of regression
* Update the installers (debian/changelog, os2/installer/make_installer.cmd, rpm/openttd.spec, windows/installer/install.nsi)
* Update the version in src/rev.cpp.in
* Update the version in src/os/windows/ottdres.rc.in
* Add a note to src/saveload/saveload.cpp about which savegame version is used in the branch.
* Update wiki pages: [[Template:en/VersionBox]]
