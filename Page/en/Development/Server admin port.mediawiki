The port the admin interface of an OpenTTD server is listening on. Please note that OpenTTD will not start a listener on this port when [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Admin password]] is not set.
The interface this port will be listened on can be defined with the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server bind ip|server_bind_addresses]] setting. If this is not set it will listen on localhost by default.

More information on the admin interface can be found here: https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/master/docs/admin_network.md
