[[Translation:en/Development/Coding style]]
'''Why a set coding style is important'''<br>
This project is an open source project. To get open source working as intended, many people should be able to comprehend the code. This implies that there is a well documented and uniform flow of code.
That does not necessarily mean that a contributor should not write optimised yet cryptic code - one should always care about performance.  However, other developers need to understand the code which means complicated parts of code '''must''' have good documentation.

'''Why we require that EVERYTHING is documented'''<br>
What is simple to some might appear very complicated to others. Documentation helps these others. Anyone should be able to improve the code. But the main reason is, that when patch contributors want their patches added to the common codebase, the code needs to be reviewed by one or more developers. Documentation makes reviewing much easier.

== Coding style for OpenTTD ==
=== Functions ===
* Function names use [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase CamelCase] without underscores.
* Opening curly bracket '''{''' for a function starts on the next line.
* Use Foo() instead of Foo(void).
<pre>
void ThisIsAFunction()
{
}
</pre>
=== Variables ===
* Variable names are all lowercase, and use "_" as separator.
* Global variables are preceded by an underscore. ("_") Use descriptive names because leading underscores are often used for system / compiler variables.
* private and protected members are preceded by "m_"
* Pointers and references should have their reference symbol next to the name (compatibility with current code).
* Variables that are declared below one another should have their type, name or reference operator, and assignment operator aligned by spaces.
* There are set names for many variables. Those are (but not limited to): Vehicle *u, *v, *w; Station *st; Town *t; Window *w; Engine *e.
*For multiple instances, use numbers "*t1, *t2" or postfixes "*st_from, *st_to".
*Declare variables upon first usage.
*Declare iterators in their loop.
<pre>
int     number         = 10;
Vehicle *u_first_wagon = v->next;
int     value          = v->value;

uint32 _global_variable = 3750;

protected:
    char m_private_array[10];

for (int i = 0;;);
</pre>
*Give the variables expedient names, this increases the readability of the code
<pre>
bool is_maglev_train = true;
if (!is_maglev_train) DoSomething();
</pre>
*Some people like to introduce copies of variables to increase readability, which can waste memory. However, in some cases, especially in code pieces which are often called, it makes sense to cache some calculated variables.
<pre>
/* Unoptimized code:
 * foo is not touched inside the loop!
 */
 for (uint8 i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  /* Do something */
  if (value_to_check == (foo * 4) % 5 + 6) DoSomething();
  /* Do something else */
 }

/* Better:
 * The used value of foo is calculated outside the loop.
 */
 const uint32 bar = (foo * 4) % 5 + 6;
 for (uint8 i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  /* Do something */
  if (value_to_check == bar) DoSomething();
  /* Do something else */
 }
</pre>

=== Enumerations / static consts ===
*Enumerations store integers that belong logically together (railtypes, string IDs, etc.). 
*Enumeration names also use CamelCase.
*Enumerators are all caps with "_" between the words. 
*Enums are not used to store single numbers.
*Enums have consecutive numbers OR
*Enums have consecutive powers of two. Powers of two (bits) are written in hex or with the shift operator.
*Enums may have special enumerators: "_BEGIN", "_END", and "INVALID_").  See example.
*The invalid always has 0xFF, 0xFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF as a value.
*Other special values are consecutively less than the invalid.  
*Variables that hold enumerators should have the type of the enumeration.
<pre>
enum DiagDirection {
	DIAGDIR_BEGIN = 0,
	DIAGDIR_NE  = 0,
	DIAGDIR_SE  = 1,
	DIAGDIR_SW  = 2,
	DIAGDIR_NW  = 3,
	DIAGDIR_END,
	INVALID_DIAGDIR = 0xFF,
	BROKEN_DIAGDIR = 0xFE,
};

enum {
	DEPOT_SERVICE       = (1 << 0),
	DEPOT_MASS_SEND     = (1 << 1),
	DEPOT_DONT_CANCEL   = (1 << 2),
	DEPOT_LOCATE_HANGAR = (1 << 3),
};

DiagDirection enterdir = DIAGDIR_NE;
</pre>
*Numbers that store single or uncorrelated data are static consts. Those may use the naming conventions of enums.
Example:
<pre>
static const int MAXIMUM_STATIONS = 42;
</pre>
*Enums are useful in GUI code: When widgets are enumerated, they are easier to access during many operations. Additionaly changes caused by modified widget sequences require less code adapting. If a widget is used like this, its enum name should be present in a comment behind the corresponding widget definition.
<pre>
/** Enum referring to the widgets of the build rail depot window */
enum BuildRailDepotWidgets {
 	BRDW_CLOSEBOX = 0,
 	BRDW_CAPTION,
 	BRDW_BACKGROUND,
 	BRDW_DEPOT_NE,
 	BRDW_DEPOT_SE,
 	BRDW_DEPOT_SW,
 	BRDW_DEPOT_NW,
};
/* ... */
/** Widget definition of the build rail depot window */
static const Widget _build_depot_widgets[] = {
{   WWT_CLOSEBOX,   RESIZE_NONE,     7,     0,    10,     0,    13, STR_00C5, STR_..},   // BRDW_CLOSEBOX
{    WWT_CAPTION,   RESIZE_NONE,     7,    11,   139,     0,    13, STR_...,  STR_...},  // BRDW_CAPTION
{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,     7,     0,   139,    14,   121, 0x0,      STR_NULL}, // BRDW_BACKGROUND
{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,    71,   136,    17,    66, 0x0,      STR_..},   // BRDW_DEPOT_NE
{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,    71,   136,    69,   118, 0x0,      STR_..},   // BRDW_DEPOT_SE
{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,     3,    68,    69,   118, 0x0,      STR_..},   // BRDW_DEPOT_SW
{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,     3,    68,    17,    66, 0x0,      STR_..},   // BRDW_DEPOT_NW
{   WIDGETS_END},
};
</pre>
*Comments on the enum values should start with "///<" to enable doxygen documentation
<pre>
enum SomeEnumeration {
	SE_BEGIN = 0,        ///< Begin of the enumeration, used for iterations
	SE_FOO = 0,          ///< Used for xy
	SE_BAR,              ///< Another value of the enumeration
	SE_SUB,              ///< Special case for z
	SE_END,              ///< End of the enumeration, used for iterations
};
</pre>

=== Control flow ===
* Put a space before the parentheses in "if", "switch", "for", and "while" statements.
* In if/else, switch, and loop statements, following statements should be inside brackets on a different line.
* Opening curly bracket '''{''' stays on the first line.
* In if without an else statements, a single statement may follow on the same line.
<pre>
  if (a == b) {
    foo();
  } else {
    bar();
  }

  if (a == b) foo();

  switch (a) {
    case 0: dosomethingshort(); break;

    case 1:
      domore();
      b = a;
      break;

    case 2: {
      int q = 345;

      doit();
      break;
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    foo();
    bar()
  }
</pre>

=== Classes===
* Classes names also use CamelCase. 
* Classes should have "public", "protected", and "private" sections.
* Within these section the order is: types, static const members, static members, members, constructors / destructors, static methods, methods.
* Deviations from above order are allowed when the code dictates it (e.g. a static const is needed for a typedef)
* Methods and members ought to be grouped logically.
* All those sorting rules sometimes conflict which one another. Please use common sense what increases legibility of the code in such a case.
* The method implementation should indicate if it is virtual or similar by using a comment.
<pre>
class ThisIsAClass {
public:
    typedef Titem_   *ItemPtr;
private:
    static const int m_max_size = 500;
    int              m_size;
    ItemPtr          *m_items;

public:
    explicit ThisIsAClass();
   ~ThisIsAClass();

    virtual void Method();
};

/*virtual*/ void Class::Method()
{
}
</pre>

=== Templates ===
Templates are a very powerful C++ tool, but they can easily confuse beginners. Thus:
* Templates are to be documented in a very clear and verbose manner. Never assume anything in the documentation.
* the template keyword and the template layout get a separate line. typenames are either "T" or preceded by a "T", integers get a single capital letter or a descriptive name preceded by "T".
<pre>
template <typename T, typename Tsomething, int N, byte Tnumber_of_something>
int Func();
</pre>

* If you are writing one or more template class in the dedicated header file, use file.hpp for its name instead of file.h. This will let others know that it is template library (includes also implementation), not just header with declarations.

=== Other important rules ===
* Put a space before and after binary operators: a + b, a == b, a & b, a <<= b, etc.. Exceptions are ".", "->" and "[]" (no spaces) and "," (just space after it).
* Put brackets where it improves readability: *(b++) instead of *b++.
* Do not put external declarations in implementation (i.e. cpp) files.
* Use const where possible.
* Do not typedef enums and structs.
* Don't treat non-flags as flags: use "if (char_pointer != NULL && *char_pointer != '\0')", not "if (char_pointer && *char_pointer)".
* Use free(p) instead of if (p != NULL) free(p). free(NULL) doesn't hurt anyone.
* No trailing whitespace. The svn server will not allow tabs or space on the end of lines. 
* Only use tabs to indent from the start of the line.
* Use /* */ for single line comments.
* Use // at the end of a command line to indicate comments.

== Documentation ==
We use [http://doxygen.org/ Doxygen] to automatically generate documentation from the source code. It scans the source files for ''recognizable'' comments. 
*'''Make your comments recognizable.'''

=== Files ===
*Put a @file command in a JavaDoc style comment at the start of the file, followed by a description.
<pre>
 /** @file
  * This is the brief description.
  * This is the detailed description here and on the following lines.
  */
</pre>
{{en/Warning|If a file lacks a '''file comment block''' then NO entities in that file will be documented by Doxygen!}}

=== Functions ===
*Comments for functions go in the .c file.
*Comments for inlines go in the .h file.
*Small inlines can have a short 3 or 4 line JavaDoc style comment.
*Completely document larger functions.
*Document obvious parameters and return values too!
<pre>
/**
 * A brief explanation of what the function does and/or what purpose it serves.
 * Then follows a more detailed explanation of the function that can span multiple lines.
 *
 * @param foo Explanation of the foo parameter
 * @param bar Explanation of the bar parameter
 * @return The sum of foo and bar (@return can be omitted if the return type is void)
 *
 * @see SomeOtherFunc()
 * @see SOME_ENUM
 * 
 * @author Bjarni, Darkvater
 * @bug Some bug description
 * @bug Another bug description which continues in the next line
 *           and ends with the following blank line
 *
 * @todo Some to-do entry
 */
static int FooBar(int foo, int bar)
{
  return foo + bar;
}
</pre>

=== Classes ===
*Document structs similarly to functions:
<pre>
/**
 * A short description of the struct.
 * More detailed description of the its usage.
 *
 * @see [link to anything of interest]
 */
struct foo {
 }
</pre>

=== JavaDoc structural commands ===

This table shows the commands you should use with OpenTTD.  The full list is [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html here].

{|
!Command!!Action!!width="200"|Example
|-
|'''@attention'''||Starts a paragraph where a message that needs attention may be entered. The paragraph will be indented.||@attention Whales crossing!
|-
|'''@author'''||Starts a paragraph where one or more author names may be entered. The paragraph will be indented. Multiple adjacent @author commands will be joined into a single paragraph and separated by commas. Alternatively, one @author command may mention several authors.||@author Bjarni
|-
|'''@brief'''||Starts a paragraph that serves as a brief description. For classes and files the brief description will be used in lists and at the start of the documentation page. For class and file members, the brief description will be placed at the declaration of the member and prepended to the detailed description. A brief description may span several lines (although it is advised to keep it brief!).||@brief This is the brief description.
|-
|'''@bug'''||Starts a paragraph where one or more bugs may be reported. The paragraph will be indented. Multiple adjacent @bug commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each bug description will start on a new line. Alternatively, one @bug command may mention several bugs.||@bug Memory leak in here?
|-
|'''@note'''||Starts a paragraph where a note can be entered. The paragraph will be indented.||@note Might be slow
|-
|'''@todo'''||Starts a paragraph where a TODO item is described. The description will also add an item to a separate TODO list. The two instances of the description will be cross-referenced. Each item in the TODO list will be preceded by a header that indicates the origin of the item.||@todo Better error checking
|-
|'''@warning'''||Starts a paragraph where one or more warning messages may be entered. The paragraph will be indented.||@warning Not thread safe!

|-
|'''@param'''||Starts a parameter description for a function parameter with name <parameter-name>. Followed by a description of the parameter. The existence of the parameter is checked and a warning is given if the documentation of this (or any other) parameter is missing or not present in the function declaration or definition.<br><br>The @param command has an optional attribute specifying the direction of the attribute. Possible values are "in" and "out".||@param  n    The number of bytes to copy<br>@param[out] dest The memory area to copy to.<br>@param[in]  src  The memory area to copy from.
|-
|'''@see'''||Starts a paragraph where one or more cross-references to classes, functions, methods, variables, files or URL may be specified. Two names joined by either :: or # are understood as referring to a class and one of its members. One of several overloaded methods or constructors may be selected by including a parenthesized list of argument types after the method name. [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/autolink.html Here] you can find detailed information about this feature.||@see OtherFunc()
|-
|'''@b'''||Displays the following word using a bold font. Equivalent to &lt;b&gt;word&lt;/b&gt;. To put multiple words in bold use &lt;b&gt;multiple words&lt;/b&gt;.||...@b this and @b that...
|-
|'''@c / @p'''||Displays the parameter <word> using a typewriter font. You can use this command to refer to member function parameters in the running text. To have multiple words in typewriter font use &lt;tt&gt;multiple words&lt;/tt&gt;.||... the @p x and @p y coordinates are used to...

=== More on Doxygen and JavaDoc ===

Doxygen knows two different kinds of comments:
*''Brief descriptions'': one-liners that describe the function roughly ([http://docs.openttd.org/annotated.html example])
*''Detailed descriptions'': as the name suggests, these contain the detailed function/purpose of the entity they describe ([http://docs.openttd.org/structBridge.html example])
You can omit either one or put them into different places but there's only one brief and one detailed description allowed for the same entity.

Doxygen knows three modes for documenting an entity:
*Before the entity
*After the entity
*In a different file
The latter is a little harder to maintain since the prototype of the entity it describes then is stored in several places (e.g. the .h file and the file with the descriptions). Also while it makes the code easier to read it also makes it easier to omit the important step of updating the description of an entity if it was changed - and we all know why that shouldn't happen ;)<br>
Because of those reasons, we will only use the first two documentation schemes.


Doxygen supports both Qt and JavaDoc comment styles:
*Qt style example: '''int i; //!< The counter for the main loop'''
*JavaDoc style example: '''int i; /**< The counter for the main loop */'''
It also supports more comment styles but those two are the ones which are standardized. For OTTD we'll be using the JavaDoc style. One of the reasons is that it has a feature that the Qt style doesn't offer: JavaDoc style comment blocks will automatically start a brief description which ends at the first dot followed by a space or new line. Everything after that will also be part of the detailed description. 


The general structure of a JavaDoc style comment is
 /**
  * This is the brief description. And this sentence contains some further explanations that will appear in the detailed description only.
  */
and the resulting descriptions of that block would be:
*''Brief description'': This is the brief description.
*''Detailed description'': This is the brief description. And this sentence contains some further explanations that will appear in the detailed description only.
The distinction between the brief and detailed descriptions is made by the dot followed by a space/newline, so if you want to use that inside the brief description you need to escape the space/newline: 
 /**
  * This is a brief description (e.g.\ using only a few words). Details go here.
  */

If you're doing a one-line comment, use:
 int i; ///< This is the description.

Also in the comment block you can include so-called structural commands which tell Doxygen what follows. In general, their area of effect begins after the command word and ends when a blank line or some other command is encountered. Also, multiple occurences of the same structural command within a comment block or the referring entity will be joined in the documentation output usually.

==Other tips==
===Remove trailing whitespace===
To find out if/where you have trailing whitespace, you can use the following (unix/bash) command:
<pre>grep -n -R --include "*.[ch]" '[ 	]$' * | grep --invert-match ".diff" | grep --invert-match ".patch"</pre>
Automatically removing whitespace is also possible with the following shell script (Note that it only checks .c and .h files):
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
IFS='
'
for i in Makefile `find . -name \*.c``find . -name \*.cpp` `find . -name \*.h` `find . -name \*.mm`
do
  (
    echo '%s/[ 	]\{1,\}$/'
    echo w
    echo q
  ) | ed $i 2> /dev/null > /dev/null
done
</pre>
