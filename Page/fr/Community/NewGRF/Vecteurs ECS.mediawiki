ECS ('''E'''xtended '''C'''argo '''S'''cheme) Vectors define 31 cargoes and 36 industries. Running all of them in one game makes the game rather complicated. To give the player control over the number of cargoes and industries, cargoes and industries are grouped into 6 blocks (''Vectors'').

One of them is the base one, that defines the minimal amount of cargo and industries, and has two additional functions (adding variable snow lines and removing default industries), which are optional.

* [[en/ECS Town vector]] 
Special houses of the [[en/ECS Town Vector]] are represented in a separate GRF [[en/ECS Houses]].

5 of them are additional ones. They can be used in any combination, with the [[en/ECS Town vector]] or independently. Every vector disables the default industries, which are similar to the industries, represented in the vector.
* [[en/ECS Basic vector II]] 
* [[en/ECS Chemical vector II]]
* [[en/ECS Machinery vector]] 
* [[en/ECS Wood vector]]
* [[en/ECS Agricultural vector]]

Outdated vectors
* [[en/ECS Basic vector]] 
* [[en/ECS Basic vector for Arctic]] 
* [[en/ECS Basic vector for Tropic]]
* [[en/ECS Chemical vector]]
* [[en/ECS Machinery vector for Tropic]]
* [[en/ECS Construction vector]]

The cargo movement between vectors is represented on the [http://george.zernebok.net/newgrf/newcargos/img/cargovectorsgeneral19.png schema]
Big schema is located [http://www.george.zernebok.net/newgrf/newcargos/img/cargovectors19.png here]


You will also need a NewGRF for a trainset that supports the additional cargo.
Possible (partially) supporting packages:
* [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]]
* [[en/Community/NewGRF/2cc TrainSet]]
