==How do I sell / delete road vehicles?==
There are a few ways to sell a road vehicle. You can sell one vehicle at a time, or sell all vehicles in a certain depot. Either way, the vehicles you want to sell need to be stopped inside the depot, so you need to send the vehicle to the depot first.

# Click on a road vehicle to open it's ''vehicle window''.
# Click the ''Send vehicle to depot'' button at the right side of the window.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-6.png|none|frame|Click on the road depot-like botton to send a road to the nearest depot.]]
# Now wait until the road vehicle has arrived at the road depot. In the meantime, you can close the road's vehicle window; you won't be needing that any more!
# As soon as the road vehicle has arrived at the road depot, click on this depot to open the ''Road Depot'' window. You now should be able to find the road vehicle in the depot's window.
# One way to sell the road vehicle is to drag it to the sell-vehicle-icon:<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-7.png|none|frame|Drag a road vehicle to the first of the three buttons at the right to sell it.]]
# Another way to sell a road vehicle is to click on the ''Sell all vehicles'' button: . Please note that this will sell all vehicles stopped inside the depot.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-8.png|none|frame|Click on the second button to sell all road vehicles which are stopped inside the depot. You'll be presented with a confirmation window asking if you're certain about what you're about to do.]]
