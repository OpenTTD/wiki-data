In this tutorial you can learn how to '''build train''' (railway) '''stations''', how to '''connect railways''' to stations in efficient ways. Building stations efficiently is very important if you wish to establish a great train empire. There are hundreds of ways you can build stations, some examples below should direct you on the right path.
__TOC__
===Building train stations===
#Open the ''Railway Construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/RailCnstr.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|none|frame|Railway Construction toolbar]]
#Click on the ''Build railroad station'' button [[File:en/Manual/RailSt.png]]. A station building window will appear. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Stationgui.png|none|frame|Train station selection window]]
#Set the ''Number of Tracks'' and the ''Platform Length''. Remember that each "unit" will take two carriages, so you choose the length of your station according to the length of the trains you want to load there, i.e. a station of 3 squares long will take one locomotive and five carriages. Longer trains can stop there also, but loading/unloading will be slower.
#Select the orientation for your station so that you can run the track in the right direction.
#Find a place for the new station on the map. Besides building on flat land you can also [[en/Build on  slopes]]. It's possible to build over existing straight rail.
#Click the mouse to build the station.

== What kinds of stations should I build? ==
That is completely up to you

The general guidelines would be:
* Trains should '''not cause traffic jams''' while entering and exiting the station
* Stations should be '''long enough''' for trains to fit completely (else loading times will be long)

Below are some examples of stations:

=== One-line stations ===
*'''One-line stations''' ''can service 1 train at a time''. Such stations serve very well when there isn't much cargo to transport.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/RailStTut One str coal.png|none|frame|1-line loading station]][[File:en/Manual/RailStTut One str pow.png|none|frame|1-line unloading station]]

*'''One-line "Ro-Ro" station''' ("Roll-On Roll-Off") (The name used is a simile. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off See Wikipedia]). The advantage of this station is that incoming trains don't have to wait for outgoing trains to leave. This is especially '''effective with multi-line stations''' (see below).<br/>[[File:en/Manual/RailStTut One aro coal.png|none|frame|1-line ro-ro loading station]][[File:en/Manual/RailStTut One aro pow.png|none|frame|1-line ro-ro unloading station]]

'''Note''': It is a good practice to make the loading-exit and unloading-entrance lines to go straight into the station, while the loading-entrance and unloading-exit lines can loop around. This way trains delivering cargo will deliver it faster as well as loaded trains can leave faster.

=== Two-line stations ===
*''Once more cargo is served in stations,'' '''two-line stations''' ''are preferred''. This could be the most used station type you build. Two stations mean two trains. Once one train is done loading, the other can start loading immediately - it doesn't have to wait for previous one to exit station.<br/>(Note: If you are not familiar with [[en/Manual/Signals#pre-signals|Pre-Signals]] yet, do not worry right now, just ignore them in the images.)<br/>[[File:en/Manual/RailStTut Two str coal.png|none|frame|]][[File:en/Manual/RailStTut Two str pow.png|none|frame|]]

*You can also consider building '''ro-ro two-line stations''' ''if more than 3 trains are using the station'' to completely avoid any traffic jams and wait times.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/RailStTut Two aro coal.png|none|frame|]][[File:en/Manual/RailStTut Two aro pow.png|none|frame|]]

=== Multi-line stations ===
Once the stations start servicing '''many trains''', '''multi-line stations''' are preferred, so there are no long wait times for trains.

*Below you can see a '''four-line single entrance/exit station'''. Just keep in mind, that ''trains might have to wait'' a little to let other trains pass.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/RailStTut Four str ore.png|none|frame|4-line single entrance/exit station]]

*And this would be a '''four-line ro-ro stations'''. ''Incoming trains do not have to wait'' when (un)loading at this station.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/RailStTut Four aro ore.png|none|frame|4-line ro-ro station]]
