|Name=Millennium Z1
|Cost=£70,312 ($140.624)
|Speed=336 km/h (210 mph)
|Weight=170 t (171,5 t)
|Power=10,000 hp (7.353 kW)
|Annual=£3,374 ($6.748)
|Designed=2005
|Lifespan=20
|Capacity=25 passengers
|Description=With two power cars, this [[en/Manual/Base Set/Monorail]] is brilliant for high-capacity passenger routes. It also looks very swish with a rake of monorail passenger carriages. When you have a long train, say, more than 8 cars, you will find the train never reaches top speed.  Join two sets together in a single train (4 power cars total) to hit top speed on the flat.
|Real-life=The Millennium Z1 train seems to resemble the German [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid "Transrapid"] high speed monorail/maglev hybrid train in that both are high speed multiple units primarily aimed at passenger transit. Although [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/Transport Tycoon Deluxe]] only appeared in 1995, eerily enough, Transrapid came into commercial use, albeit in a limited form, in late 2004 - rather similar to its service date in game, and was in development when Transport Tycoon first appeared.
