===<u>Routing</u>===
====Pathfinder for trains====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
Select the pathfinding algorithm for trains. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#00693E">'''NPF'''</span> or <span style="color:#00693E">'''YAPF'''</span> <span style="color:blue">(Recommended)</span>

{{en/-}}
====Forbid trains and ships from making 90&deg; turns====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.4.0)}}
Disallows trains and ships from making sharp 90 degree turns. The NPF or YAPF pathfinder for trains needs to be enabled for this option to work for trains.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([pf] forbid_90_deg = <true|false>)

====Pathfinder for road vehicles====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
Select the pathfinding algorithm for road vehicles. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:#00693E">'''NPF'''</span> or <span style="color:#00693E">'''YAPF'''</span> <span style="color:blue">(Recommended)</span>

====Road vehicle queueing (with quantum effects)====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.2.0)}}
Trucks and buses [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Road vehicle queueing|queue up]] at a busy station rather than turning around.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([pf] roadveh_queue = <true|false>)
{{en/-}}
====Pathfinder for ships====
{{en/Feature|0.6|align="right"|text=(since 0.6.0)}}
Select the pathfinding algorithm for ships. The original is the default and recommended setting, but you can select newer pathfinder. YAPF for ships has the advantage of not having to use buoys for long distances, but has serious performance issues when using a large number of ships (i.e. more than ten).

===<u>Autorenew</u>===
Are you sick of replacing all your vehicles with the same model once every twenty years? Let this setting take care of that for you. When you enable it, vehicles will automatically be replaced. With the following settings you can define the autorenew as you like. (If you want to replace them with a different model, you should use [[en/Manual/Replace vehicles]] instead.)

{{en/Note|If the vehicle does not enter a service depot, it will not be renewed. You will not get a 'vehicle is getting old' warning!}}

====Autorenew vehicle when it gets old====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.3)}}
Vehicles are automatically replaced when they get old, provided that the same vehicle type is still available for purchase.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([company] engine_renew = <true|false>)
{{en/-}}
====Autorenew when vehicle is ... months before/after max age====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.4)}}
If autorenew is enabled, a vehicle is automatically renewed the next time it enters a service depot when its age reaches the set amount of months before or after its maximum age.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:red">'''-12'''</span> to <span style="color:#00693E">'''12'''</span>
:* <span style="color:red">-12</span> means that the vehicle is replaced 12 months before it gets old.
:* <span style="color:#00693E">+12</span> means that the vehicle is replaced 12 months after it gets old.
:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([company] engine_renew_months = <num_val>)
{{en/-}}
====Autorenew minimum needed money for renew====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.4)}}
If autorenew is enabled and a vehicle is going to be replaced, the amount money of the player has needs to be more than this value plus the cost of the new vehicle.

If the value is, for example, £200,000, a new vehicle costs £10,000 and you have £205,000, the vehicle will not be replaced. Instead, you will get a warning that autorenew has failed on that vehicle.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:red">'''£0'''</span> to <span style="color:#00693E">'''£4,000,000''' ($8,000,000)</span>

===<u>Servicing</u>===
====Service intervals are in percents====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.4)}}
When this switch is on the service intervals are considered to be in percents of the max. reliability rather than days. For example, if an engine has the max reliability of 80% and you set the service interval to 10% then it will go to depot at 72%.

====Service helicopters at helipads automatically====
{{en/Feature|Old|align="right"|text=(since 0.3.3)}}

When enabled, this ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Settings/Dynamic Engines]]'' feature allows multiple [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] vehicle sets to exist side-by-side.

Note: using multiple vehicle sets side-by-side might result in very high or very low purchase and running costs for vehicles. Mixing wagons and trains from different train sets might result in graphical errors.
