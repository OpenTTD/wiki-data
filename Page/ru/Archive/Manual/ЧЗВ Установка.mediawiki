Данные ЧЗВ освещают установку OpenTTD.

== Что мне нужно для запуска OpenTTD? ==
Вам необходимо работать в одной из [[ru/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Операционная система|поддерживаемых операционных систем]]. Затем проверьте, что ваша система удовлетворяет [[ru/Archive/Manual/Системные требования|системным требованиям]].

== Как установить OpenTTD? ==
=== В ОС Windows: ===
:*Очень просто, только несколько шагов:
:#Загрузить дистрибутив OpenTTD для ОС Windows со [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable страницы загрузки]- или просто полный ZIP-архив в том же месте.
:#Запустите файл с дистрибутивом.
:#Выберите настройки по умолчанию, позволяющие устанавить базовый набор файлов.
:#Запустите OpenTTD.
:#И вы уведите заставку игры.

:Также, вы можете, загрузить [[ru/Development/Часто задаваемые вопросы разработчика#iskhodnyi-kod|исходные коды игры]], если считаете что это наиболее простой способ получения игры.

=== В ОС Linux: ===
* Как и большинство вещей Linux, существует множество путей получения рабочей версии OpenTTD:
:* Вы можете найти OpenTTD для вашей системы управления пакетами, такие как Aptitude, Yum, Portage и YaST. Для получения информации о том какая система используется, проверяет руководство вашего дистрибутива или смотрите на сайте производителя дистрибутива. Также через систему управления пакетами ваше ОС очень просто установить основные файлы ресурсов игры.
:* Вы можете найти найти пакеты для некоторых дистрибутивов на [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable странице проекта], такие как .deb и .rpm файлы
:**You'll need to put a copy of base resource files like OpenGFX into ~/.openttd/data (create that directory, if it doesn't exist).
:* You can download the source and compile the game yourself! You can read how to do this here: [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on GNU∕Linux and 🟉BSD]].
:**You'll need to put a copy of base resource files like OpenGFX into ~/.openttd/data (create that directory, if it doesn't exist).

* Step-by-step in Ubuntu 8.04 onwards:
:* Goto 'Ubuntu Software Centre'.
:* Search for 'openttd'
:*Install Openttd as it comes
:* You can download and install sounds and graphics in the game itself
:** The game data will be saved in "/usr/share/games/openttd/data"
:** Savegames / screenshots etc will be saved in "/home/{username}/.openttd". (Note that this directory may be hidden. To see it click 'View' in the File Browser in your username hame directory and tick 'show hidden files').

=== On Mac OS X: ===
:*Quite simple, only a few steps:
:#''Obtain'' a copy of [http://www.openttd.org/download-opengfx OpenGFX]
:#Unpack OpenGFX it into ~/Documents/OpenTTD/data (create that directory, if it doesn't exist)
:#Get the OSX bundle for OpenTTD from the [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable downloads page].
:#Mount the downloaded image and copy OpenTTD into a folder of your choice, i.e. /Applications/OpenTTD/ (it is recommended that it's empty as OpenTTD will add files to it).
:#[optional] Also make a "gm" folder, and copy the .gm files across into it for all the cheesy midi goodness.'''[*2]'''
:#Run OpenTTD!
:#[optional] You can now conveniently install sound and music sets be using ingame content download

=== On other systems: ===
:*If it is a unix-like system you have good chances to play OpenTTD on it. It runs on more different systems and architectures than mentioned here.
:#Look into the [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|Operating System List]] whether there are reports on your system.
:#Make sure, that the [http://libsdl.org SDL library] is available for your platform and installed on your system.
:#Download the OpenTTD source code and try to compile the game yourself.
:#Add an entry to the [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|Operating System List]], even if you were not successful.

== Can I use the original TTD files? ==

In short: No TTD files are needed, free base graphics, sounds and music do exist. But you can still use the base files from TTD:

:*If you are not using the installer to install OpenTTD, (or are just curious) you need to copy certain files by hand.
:Required files; put these in the <i>data/</i> folder:
::* Graphic files: <b>trg1r.grf</b>, <b>trgcr.grf</b>, <b>trghr.grf</b>, <b>trgir.grf</b>, <b>trgtr.grf</b>
:::*If you are using the DOS version of TTD to copy the files from, you need the files which are named above but without the "R" on the end, e.g. trg1.grf etc.
::* Sound files: <b>sample.cat</b>
:If you also want music, ''(the all important cheesy midi goodness)'' copy the following files to the  <i>gm/</i> folder:
::* Music files: <b>*.gm</b>
::If there is no gm folder, just create it in the main openttd folder, and put the files there. Note that DOS version of TTD does not have <b>*.gm</b> files.

On *nix computers, you need make sure you have permission to view the above files as a normal user, otherwise, you will only be able to run OpenTTD as root.

== What about nightly builds? ==
The nightly builds can be used parallel to stable build. Download the latest nightly build archive, then extract it into a new folder without installation required. Just run the binary.

To always play the latest nightly you can use an [[en/Archive/Community/OpenTTD Updaters|updater]] to update to latest [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] when you start the OpenTTD.
