[[Translation:Category/en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Primary Industries]]

Primary [[en/Manual/Industries|industries]], such as [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Coal Mine|mines]], provide cargo without requiring anything. 

This OpenTTD definition is not quite the same as the traditional one in that [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Bank|Banks]] provide [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Valuables]] without requiring any input, but money is not a natural resource and so traditionally these are Tertiary, or service, industries. 

==Mechanics==

These industries usually increase or decrease production on their own, depending on their [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/#station-rating|station rating]] (exceptions include the [[en/Manual/Climates#temperate|temperate]] version of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Oil Wells]]). If they are poorly serviced, their production will decrease and vice versa. If their production rate remains too low, they will close down and disappear.
