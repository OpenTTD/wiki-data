Cheers for that, GeekToo. And thumbs up for your continuous effort to make the extra zoom levels patch even better. Actually, progress was too fast for me :shock: , as I've been working on a stumpy version of the Kirby Paul Tank engine (a.k.a. GWR Class 5700 Pannier Tank)...
Unfortunately, the prototype is some 9 meters long, so with the tendency of OTTD to shorten all vehicles (12.5 m oil tankers, anyone?), it doesn't look right when stretched to tile length. So it's more suitable for v9, until vehicles of variable length are possible :mrgreen:
This time, the engine sports company colours (made to fit ben_robbins wagons) and is aligned correctly (well, hopefully...). And as the default steam plumes don't fit, I also made new steam.
Again, change whatever you like, licence is included in the .tar files

BTW, a :bow: to brupje for his python script, which makes rendering much faster and easier!
