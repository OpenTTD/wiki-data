This comparison chart shows how company colours are displayed in the 32bpp_extra_zoom patch, depending on the colour values (Hue, Saturation, Value) of the original colours in the sprite. Note that the hue values are separated by approximately 60 degrees for the three colours (blue, magenta, red) chosen. That is why blue and red (two of the basic colours of the RGB colour system) lead to the same company colour, while magenta (the mixed colour of blue and red) is displayed differently. This is also evident from the "spectrum" that is shown in the lower right box.
"Colours" with no saturation value like black and white have no company colour applied.
